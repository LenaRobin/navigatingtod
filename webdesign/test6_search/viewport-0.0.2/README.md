viewport.js
===========


`viewport.js` is a small javascript library which ships the document
sections with additional properties containing the viewport scrolling
position relatively to the sections. Using these properties you can
create a custom scrolling indicator or a navigation menu precisely
reflecting the scrolling state:

- [demo page](http://asvd.github.io/viewport) / [and its
source](https://github.com/asvd/asvd.github.io/tree/master/viewport);

- [home page of intence project](http://asvd.github.io/intence) also
  uses `viewport.js` for its navigation menu.

In other words, `viewport.js` is similar to
[other](http://davidwalsh.name/js/scrollspy)
[scrollspy](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy) [solutions]
(https://github.com/sxalexander/jquery-scrollspy), but has the
following advantages:

- it is written on vanilla javascript, does not have dependencies and
  works anywhere;

- its size is only 1566 bytes minified;

- it has a simple and flexible API which shows:

 - which section is currently displayed in the viewport;

 - where is the viewport relatively to each section;

 - where are the viewport edges relatively to each section;

 - where should the viewport be scrolled to in order to show a
   particular section.


### Usage

Download the
[distribution](https://github.com/asvd/viewport/releases/download/v0.0.2/viewport-0.0.2.tar.gz),
unpack it and load the `viewport.js` in a preferable way (that is an
UMD module):

```html
<script src="viewport.js"></script>
```

Add the `section` class to the sections:

```html
<div id=firstSection class=section>
    First section content goes here...
</div>

<div id=secondSection class=section>
    Second section content goes here...
</div>
```

This is it - now the sections are shipped with additional properties
and you can fetch them on viewport scroll in order to reflect the
scrolling state in an indicator:

```js
// use document.body if the whole page is scrollable
var myViewport = document.getElementById('myViewport');
var firstSection = document.getElementById('firstSection');

myViewport.addEventListener(
    'scroll',
    function() {
        var location = firstSection.viewportTopLocation;
        console.log(
            'The viewport is at ' + location +
            ' relatively to the first section'
        );
    },
    false
);
```


Section elements contain the following properties:

- `viewportTopLoctaion` - progress of a viewport scrolling through the
  section. If the section is visible in the viewport, the value is
  between 0 (section start) and 1 (section end). Values <0 or >1 mean
  that the section is outside of the viewport. This property reflects
  the location of the viewport as a whole;

- `veiwportTopStart` - precise position of the top edge of the
  viewport relatively to the section. The value has the same meaning
  as for the `viewportTopLocation`;

- `viewportTopEnd` - same for the bottom border of the viewport.


Use `viewportTopLocation` if you want to display a scrolling progress
as a single value. Use `viewportTopStart` and `viewportTopEnd`
properties together if you need to display the scrolling position as a
range (like on a scrollbar), or if you need to know the rate of how
much the viewport covers the section.

There are also the similar properties for the horizontal scrolling
direction:

- `viewportLeftLocation` - horizontal scrolling position of the
  viewport relatively to the section;

- `viewportLeftStart` - viewport left edge position;

- `viewportLeftEnd` - veiwport right edge position;

The following properties contain the scroll targets where the viewport
should be scrolled in order to display a particular section:

- `viewportScrollTopTarget`

- `viewportScrollLeftTarget`

You will need them to determine where to scroll the viewport when user
clicks a menu button pointing to the section. Always use [natural
scroll](http://github.com/asvd/naturalScroll) when scrolling
programmatically.

If a viewport is not the whole page, add the `viewport` class to the
the element which actually performs scrolling:


```html
<div class=viewport id=myViewport>
  <div id=firstSection class=section>
      First section content goes here...
  </div>

  <div id=secondSection class=section>
      Second section content goes here...
  </div>
</div>
```

The viewport element additionally contains the `currentSection`
property which points to the section element currently visible in the
viewport (more precisely, the section which is the closest to the
viewport):


```js
var currentSection = document.getElementById('myViewport').currentSection;
```

If you change / create the sections dynamically after the page
load, invoke `viewport.reset()` to update the listeners.

If you create a navigation panel reflecting the scrolling state,
replace the scrollbars with [intence](http://asvd.github.io/intence)
indicator: it designates a scrollable area in more clear and intuitive
way comparing to the ordinary scrollbar.
