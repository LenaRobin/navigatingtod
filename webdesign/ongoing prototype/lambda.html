																<p><em>Introduction</em></p>
								<p>The initial idea that led to the preparation of this publication was not a reflection of the editors’ wish to merely add another publication focusing on a critique of the relationship between creative industries and capital to the huge corpus of similar publications taking a critical stance towards the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of co-optation of creativity, creative industries, art or the domain of abstraction in general by capital. Even though, precisely through the logic of the mass production of critical texts dealing with the above-mentioned context, this publication as well will ultimately exist in such a register, the distinctive feature of this publication is its aspiration to place the relationship between creativity and capital in the context of an analysis wherein <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> is treated as the framework of a broader relationship of domination, which to a great degree goes beyond the currently popular critical niche focused on analyzing the relationship between creativity, abstraction or representation in general and capital.</p>
								<p>The vast majority of such publications are characterized by such a perception of the relationship between <span class="importantword">creativity</span> and capital, which implies that the co-optation and exploitation of work, <span class="importantword">creativity</span> and attention occurs in a post-class, post-ideological or post-colonial context of the so-called “networked world or networked democracy”, wherein all subjects and their actions are reportedly subjected to the logic of capital in the same way. Regardless of whether we speak of the ideological use of the concept of <span class="importantword">creativity</span> in the name of rationalization of the neoliberal strategies of transforming the city into ghettoized class and racial apartheids, whether we speak of the exploitation of attention (the economy of attention) by financial capital or generally about the epistemological positioning of <span class="importantword">creativity</span>, abstraction or the domain of representation within the dominant form of rationalization and reproduction of <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>, this publication strives to retain a critical view that sees these <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es as forms of the perpetuation of the hegemony of <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> in the so-called contemporary era.</p>
								<p>As regards the temporal framework encompassed in this publication, although certain texts, through the logic of the necessity of historicization of specific strategies and practices refer to historical periods preceding the 21st century, the majority of the texts contained in this publication refer to social and political <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es from the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century, that is, the current period. In this sense, the dominant ideological discourses, strategies and power relations of today constitute the focus of attention of the topics of this publication.</p>
								<p>This publication, then, occupies a position that treats “the networked world”, its democracies, cognitivities, attention and culture as domains wherein, or with help of which, forms of the reproduction of <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> as a heterogeneous form of hegemony, primarily of the First World of capital or the West, are reorganized, “modernized”. The title “The Gray Zones of <span class="importantword">creativity</span> and Capital” does not, therefore, point primarily to instances of vagueness and dichotomy in the analysis of the social meaning of the cooperation between <span class="importantword">creativity</span> and capital, but assumes a critical stance towards “gray areas” in those dominant interpretations of <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> that try to view it as a post-ideological, post-class or post-bloc system.</p>
								<p>In this sense, the introductory text by Santiago Castro-Gómez, entitled “The Missing Chapter of Empire - Postmodern reorganization of coloniality and post-Fordist <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>”, critically addresses the interpretation of contemporary <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> (presented in the text “<span class="importantword">Empire</span>” by Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt) that views it as a system of equal exploitation of all. Castro-Gomez sees the <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> of today as a modernized form of the colonial division of the world, in which the First World of capital, the West, still retains a monopoly on defining progress, and in which that same world retains a surplus of privileges within the framework of the unbalanced distribution of global wealth. Even though the majority of texts in this publication are not decolonialist in character, we use Castro-Gomez’s text as a form of positioning this publication in relation to the interpretation of contemporary <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> that we see as a modernized colonial power structure of the First World of capital.</p>
								<p>The text by Jonathan Beller entitled “Within the Image” analyses in a similar manner, but from a different perspective, the socio-political meaning and the ideological effects of the capitalist exploitation of the image and attention. From a structuralist position, Beller analyses the role which the commodification of the image, attention and abstraction plays in the neoliberal free market and its ideologies, but in those same contemporary forms of <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> the author also detects a specific colonial and racial relationship of domination.</p>
								<p>Josephine Berry Slater’s text “Neutralizing Engaged Subjects in the Creative City”, relying on Foucault’s theoretical apparatus, criticizes the biopolitical and repressive character of the neoliberal strategies of transforming urban Great Britain in the post-Thatcher era. Even though Slater locates the roots of the neoliberal strategies of social engineering and the laissez-faire concept of organizing society and the economy in Thatcher’s attack on the role of society in the regulation of society, the author links the roots of the derogation of subversive social engagement with the contemporary forms of organization of <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>, in an alliance with the modern art mainstream.</p>
								<p>Marc James Leger’s text “The Agency of Art in the Unconscious” critically addresses contemporary art as a form of reproducing the nullity of social significance contained in the domain of <span class="importantword">creativity</span> in <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>. Relying to a large extent on the psychoanalytic theory of Lacan and Žižek, Leger structurally links contemporary art and the domain of <span class="importantword">creativity</span> in general to modern political economy in the sense in which he sees contemporary art as a form of neutralization of radical fiction that would antagonize the above-mentioned relationship with capitalist economy.</p>
								<p>“The Art of New Class Geography of the City - Culture-guided urban regeneration serving the modernization of the periphery” is a text by Ana Vilenica wherein she critically addresses the practices and principles contained in the neoliberal establishment of a class geography of urban environments in Serbia. Vilenica’a text does not remain at the level of analyzing the neoliberal strategies of contemporary <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>, but also deals with the broader meaning of class and racial principles invested in the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of modernization in general. In this sense, Vilenica analyses the effects of an alliance of sorts between capital and creative industries, emphasizing the role of art and culture in contemporary capitalist ideological rhetorics.</p>
								<p>Sandi Abram’s text “The Creative Factory: Collective <span class="importantword">creativity</span> and Autonomy in the Neoliberal Machine of Creative Industries” analyses the effects of postfordist cognitive <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> on the social scene in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Abram assumes a critical stance towards the public-private partnership model invested in the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of producing a new class geography of urban environments, which is a model that Abram sees as a part of a broader pan-European paradigm of gentrification. Analyzing the transformation of the Rog factory in Ljubljana, Abram sees the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of gentrification as parts of a broader capitalist strategy of turning the entire society into a factory and/or a specific commodified niche in the hierarchies of capitalist exploitation.</p>
								<p>The text by Irmgard Emmelheinz, entitled “Neoliberalism and the Autonomy of Art: The Culture of Power, the Power of Culture” analyses the effects of reconfiguring the social-political role of the figure of “Other” in the context of Mexico and/or the broader region of Latin America. Emmelheinz takes a critical position in relation to postmodern democratic culture and the institutions of contemporary art than she sees to be a part of the broader <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of the utilization of culture by <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>. The author concludes that within the space of division of political and aesthetic representation occurs a paradigmatic change in the role of culture in neoliberal <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>, whose autonomy no longer points to its ability to produce a radical criticism of the system, but precisely the opposite – to its total depoliticization.</p>
								<p>First of all, the function of all these texts within the context of this publication is to expand the critique of <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> to include a critique of all the normative practices contained in <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> as a hegemonic power structure, primarily of the First World of capital, and then also of all the other actors involved in maintaining the hierarchies of exploitation.</p>
								<p>Since the region of the former Yugoslavia is still undergoing the obscene <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of the so-called transition to a free market economy, dictated by the colonial centre in the West and carried out by a politically impotent ethnocentric nation state, the role of this publication is to contribute to the interpretation of these <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es as <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of a devastating derogation of the political role of the state, the concept of political control of society and devastation of society in general as a collective which transcends, that is, which should transcend the centrality of ethnicity. This publication, then, establishes a structural connection between the reportedly separated concepts of modernization and the establishment of capitalist hierarchies of exploitation.</p>
								<p>In this sense, all those <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es – such as the depoliticization of culture, subjecting culture and art to the logic of the free market, that is, separating the state from culture – which are presented in the public discourse by the ruling elites and free market proponents as strategies and ideological principles necessary for a transformation of society, politics and the economy into functional modern societies – are viewed in this publication as strategies and ideological principles serving to establish capitalist modernity only. This publication, then, positions itself radically against the imposition and legitimization of such an ideological supernarrative wherein only the hierarchies of exploitation, radical class and ethnic divisions and the impotence of politics reduced to an administrative professional category will be functional to the detriment of society which has yet to be politicized and/or reinvented as a collective whose needs surpass the needs of the free market and the specific actors who profit the most from its logics.</p>

								<p><em>Postmodern reorganization of coloniality and post-Fordist <span class="importantword">capitalism</span></em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
								<p>This paper starts with a sense of puzzlement about this question: Is there only one world or are there various possible worlds? I want to reformulate this question in the following way: is it possible to share a single world where many worlds are possible? Or to put it yet another way, is it possible to share a world where different ways of knowing that world can coexist and complement each other? A world where epistemological plurality can be recognized and valued? Unfortunately, my answer to these questions would have to be a ‘provisional no’ because to this day, at least for the last 500 years, it has not been possible to recognize the epistemological plurality of the world. On the contrary, a single way of knowing the world, the scientific-technical rationality of the Occident, has been postulated as the only valid episteme, that is to say the only episteme capable of generating real knowledge about nature, the economy, society, morality and people’s happiness. All other ways of knowing the world have been relegated to the sphere of doxa, as if they were a part of modern science’s past, and are even considered an ‘epistemological obstacle’ to attaining the certainty of knowledge.</p>
								<p>What made this possible? How was one form of rationality able to establish itself as the only legitimate way of knowing the world? By virtue of what kind of power were other ways of knowing expulsed from the map of epistemes and downgraded to the underdeveloped character of doxa? The ‘Coloniality of power’ is the category used by some social scientists and philosophers of Latin America to describe the phenomenon by which a rigid hierarchy between different knowledge systems exists in the world. This hierarchization is not new: its roots are based in the European colonial experience, and specifically in the idea that the colonizer possesses an ethnic and cognitive superiority over the colonized. It is for this reason that our question about the coexistence of diverse legitimate ways of producing knowledge should necessarily involve an analysis of the coloniality of power in the contemporary world. Our question would then be: Do we live in a word where the old epistemological hierarchies made rigid by modern colonialism have disappeared, or on the contrary, are we witnessing a postmodern reorganization of coloniality?</p>
								<p>In their famous book <span class="importantword">Empire</span>, Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri (from here forward H/N), offer a clear answer to this question. Their thesis is that the modern/colonial hierarchies have disappeared, and that there now exists a unique opportunity for the multitude to generate a plurality of possible worlds in opposition to the single world of <span class="importantword">Empire</span>. However my thesis would be that <span class="importantword">Empire</span> is only a postmodern renewal of the rigid epistemological hierarchies that existed under modernity, making it difficult to think of a radical democracy of the multitude as H/N propose. To defend this thesis I will present the following: first I will briefly outline the arguments that H/N offer to support the death of colonialism in the contemporary world. I will then give a critical analysis of their arguments, showing what problems are manifested in the genealogy of <span class="importantword">Empire</span> by H/N. Finally, I will come to a case study that serves as an example of what constitutes the postmodern reorganization of coloniality in <span class="importantword">Empire</span>.</p>
								<h3 id="the-era-of-empire">The era of empire</h3>
								<p>The general thesis of H/N is that both imperialism and colonialism have reached their end because they are both specifically modern devices of the exploitation of human labor, and today capital does not need these historical forms to reproduce itself. On the contrary, imperialism and colonialism, which were very useful to the expansion of capital for more than 400 years, actually became an obstacle for global <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>. For this reason these forms were overtaken by the dynamics of the world market itself (Hardt &amp; Negri 2001, p. 323).</p>
								<p>Firstly, H/N associate colonialism directly with the formation of European nation-states in the seventeenth century. In the seventeenth century, the intellectual elites and politicians of Europe found themselves in a kind of civil war because the ‘humanist revolution’ of the sixteenth century<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> that established the ‘plane of immanence’, was threatened by the ‘illustrious counterrevolution’. The intention of this counterrevolution was to exercise control over the constitutive desires of the ‘multitude’ (that is to say the early commercial bourgeoisie of Europe) and to establish rational standards in all areas of society. Finally, what the Enlightenment proposed was to legitimate, by way of science, the establishment of disciplinary apparatuses that permitted the normalization of bodies and minds to orient them towards productive work. But it is precisely in the enlightened project of normalization where colonialism fits so well. Constructing the profile of the ‘normal’ subject that <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> needed (white, male, owner, worker, heterosexual, etc.) necessarily required the image of an ‘other’ located in the exteriority of European space. The identity of the bourgeois subject in the seventeenth century is constructed in opposition to the images of ‘savages’ who lived in America, Africa and Asia that chroniclers and travelers had circulated throughout Europe. Therefore present-day values of ‘civilization’ are affirmed in contrast to the barbaric past in which all that are ‘outside’ live. The history of humanity is seen then as the uncontestable progress towards a mode of capitalist civilization in which Europe is the standard imposed on all the remaining forms of life on the planet. The transcendent apparatus of the Enlightenment constructs a unified European identity that requires the figure of the ‘colonial Other’ (Hardt &amp; Negri 2001, p. 149).</p>
								<p>Now in the nineteenth century, once the Fordist mode of production had consolidated its hegemony, colonialism continued to play an important role in the reproduction of capital, thanks to the struggle that arose between the different industrial empires of Europe. In this phase, colonialism is subordinated to the formation of European industrial society and the need to conquer outside markets as a source of resources. Here H/N yield to the way classical Marxist theory drew the limits of the concept of Imperialism. The ‘era of imperialism’, according to authors like Lenin, Rosa Luxemburg and Eric Hobsbawm, took place between 1880 and 1914, that is in the moment in which the larger part of the planet was under the political or commercial domination of the industrialized powers of Europe: the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. These countries competed fiercely for control of ‘zones of influence’ that could accelerate the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of industrialization, a competition that would culminate in the First World War. From this perspective, colonialism appears as a subproduct of the development of industrial <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> in certain European nation-states. This situation persisted until well into the twentieth century, until the first two decades of the Cold War, when the larger part of the colonized countries declared their independence from Europe, in the moment when <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> started to make the move from a Fordist economy to a post-Fordist mode of production.</p>
								<p>H/N’s thesis is that with the advent of postfordism, world <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> enters into the last and definitive stage of its history: <span class="importantword">Empire</span>. In the new phase, the type of production that now dominates the world economy is not that of commodities like in industrial society, but that of symbols and abstract language (Hardt &amp; Negri 2001, pp. 286-297). It is not the manufacturing of physical objects but the manipulation of data images and symbols that characterizes the post-Fordist economy. This hegemony of immaterial work requires that production stop being tied to specific territories and that the factory is no longer the paradigmatic center of work. Globalization not only transplanted production outside the physical walls of the factory, radically transforming the relation between capital and work, it also converted colonialism into a historic relic of humanity. In the moment in which knowledge becomes the principal productive force of global capital, replacing the physical labor of slaves and the manual work of the factory, colonialism stops being necessary for the reproduction of capital.</p>
								<p>In effect, colonialism was a historical formation that grew in a context where you could still talk about an ‘inside’ and an ‘outside’ of capital. In its expansive logic, capital needed to conquer markets, not capitalists, and that explains the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of European colonization (Hardt &amp; Negri 1000, pp. 228-233). But when the <span class="importantword">Empire</span> had filled all social spaces with its logic, when production was no longer tied to specific territories, when the time of the ‘open borders’ of capital had ended, there is no longer an ‘outside’ where the categories of ‘colonialism’ and ‘imperialism’ can be applied.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The argument that <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> has reached its end relies also on the thesis that the modern sovereignty of the nation state has declined and ceded to the postmodern sovereignty of <span class="importantword">Empire</span>. If colonialism was a creation of the sovereignty of nation-states in Europe, then the decline of that sovereignty would necessarily mean the end of colonialism. The sovereignty that we are now living is not modern, but postmodern. Colonialism, as a functional element of the project of modernity, is a thing of the past. The colonial representations of the ‘other’ that affirmed European identity are no longer necessary, because Europe is no longer the ‘center’ of the world-system. In fact, <span class="importantword">Empire</span> does not need to have more centers. According to H/N, ‘our postmodern <span class="importantword">Empire</span> doesn’t have a Rome’ (p. 310), that is to say that now we do not divide the world hierarchically into centers, peripheries and semi-peripheries, as Wallerstein would have wanted it. Without centers, without peripheries and without an outside, <span class="importantword">Empire</span> doesn’t need the representations of the ‘other’ to affirm its identity, because <span class="importantword">Empire</span> doesn’t have an identity. <span class="importantword">Empire</span> is smooth and spectral: it is found everywhere, without being located anywhere at that same time. For this reason, affirm H/N, the ‘dialectic of colonialism’ has stopped being functional today.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
								<p>For H/N, the territorial dichotomies of center and periphery are obsolete, because in <span class="importantword">Empire</span> it is no longer possible to demarcate large geographical zones as privileged sites of production. There certainly exists an ‘uneven development’, but the lines of division and hierarchy are now not found along national boarders (p. 324). There is also poverty and misery rooted in the large cities of Europe and the United States, the Third World inside the first, while in the countries of the ‘South’, like in India and Brazil, there exist post-Fordist elites that live better than those of the ‘North’. Today, North and South are global spaces that no longer define an ‘international order’. The principal economic actors of capitalist postmodernism are not nation-states but multinational corporations that do not operate on the basis of settling in specific territories. Uneven development is not territorial, since ‘all the levels of production can exist simultaneously and together [in the same territory], from the highest levels of technology, productivity and accumulation, to the lowest’ (p. 324).</p>
								<p>To summarize: For H/N, the new hierarchy of global power is no longer understandable if we continue to think from the field opened and made visible by the concept of Imperialism, where the only truly geopolitical actors are the nation-states that operate according to a center/periphery logic. Today, the structure of the postmodern world system does not operate primarily on the basis of inter-state relations and the struggle between metropolitan States for hegemonic control over the peripheries. <span class="importantword">Empire</span> is not English, French, Arab or American, but simply capitalist. This explains the reordering of the old geopolitical divisions based on territories (North and South, center and periphery) in function of the new global hierarchy of power, and also explains why colonialism is a phenomenon of the past. In <span class="importantword">Empire</span>, old inequalities and colonial segmentations between the countries have not disappeared, but have acquired another form. There are inequalities now that do not have an imperialist form because both imperialism and colonialism become obstacles for the expansion of capital (Hardt &amp; Negri 2001, p. 323).</p>
								<h3 id="the-darker-side-of-the-force">The darker side of the force</h3>
								<p>I want to propose a critique of H/N that salvages some elements of their theory of postmodern <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>, but which also points to the deficiencies in their analysis of colonialism. Formulated in positive terms, my thesis will be that the concept of <span class="importantword">Empire</span> allows a critical analysis of global <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> that supplements, and in some cases replaces, analyses using the concept of imperialism. The numerous critics of the book are correct in that there continue to be imperial rules and actors that are the same as those conceived under the concept of imperialism. However, there are other rules and other global actors becoming hegemonic in the post-Fordist economy that the concept of imperialism fails to grasp. It is here where the concept of <span class="importantword">Empire</span> reveals its importance. Formulated in negative terms, my thesis will be that the genealogy of <span class="importantword">Empire</span>, as it is reconstructed by H/N, makes the understanding of the typically modern phenomena that persist in <span class="importantword">Empire</span> difficult, such as occidentalism, epistemological hierarchies and racism. From my point of view, the genealogy of <span class="importantword">Empire</span> proposed by H/N is incomplete and should be complemented with what in this work I call the ‘missing chapter of <span class="importantword">Empire</span>’.</p>
								<p>I want to begin by alluding to an article published by Walter Mignolo in the year 2002 titled ‘Colonialismo global, <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>o and hegemonía epistémica.' In this text, Mignolo affirms that the concept of <span class="importantword">Empire</span> elaborated by H/N only shows one side of globalization, its postmodern side, completely ignoring its darker side (Mignolo 2002, p. 227). What is the ‘darker side’ of postmodernism? For a number of years, Mignolo has worked on the subject of colonial representations in modern occidental thinking. In his book, The Darker Side of the Renaissance, Mignolo appeals to the classic gesture of modern critical theory: it is not possible to understand the humanism of the Renaissance if we ignore its historical aprioris, that is to say its historical conditions of possibility. In the pen of Wallerstein, Mignolo says that the capitalist economy-world that arose in the sixteenth century constitutes the global scene in which the humanistic thought of the Renaissance developed. But this economy-world comes marked from the beginning with what the sociologist Aníbal Quijano calls a ‘structural heterogeneity’. The economic and political domination of the economy-world by Europe is sustained by colonial exploitation and is not conceivable without it. That is to say, the grand works of humanism of the Renaissance cannot be considered only ‘spiritual’ phenomena, independent of the modern/colonial world-system in which they materialized. The ‘gold of the Indies’ made the great flow of riches from America to the European Mediterranean possible, a situation that generated the conditions for the ‘humanistic revolution’ of the sixteenth century to flourish. Therefore, the ‘structural heterogeneity’ that Mignolo and Quijano talk about is based on the premise that the modern and the colonial are simultaneous phenomena in time and space. Thinking of the Renaissance as a European phenomenon, separated from the modern/colonial economy-world that sustains it, is equivalent to generating an incomplete and mystified image of modernity.</p>
								<p>But this is precisely what started to occur in the eighteenth century. Mignolo affirms that Enlightenment (Aufklärung) thinking generates what the Argentinean philosopher Enrique Dussel calls ‘the eurocentric myth of modernity’. This myth consists of the elimination of the structural heterogeneity of modernity, in the name of a lineal <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> in which Europe appears as a privileged place of enunciation and generation of knowledge. The traditional and the modern stop coexisting and now appear as successive phenomena in time. Coloniality is not seen as a constitutive phenomenon but rather as a derivative of modernity. This would be an exclusively European phenomenon originating in the Middle Ages, and that later spread around the world through Intra-European experiences like the Italian Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. In this way, the myth of eurocentrism identifies European particularity with universality tout-court, and identifies coloniality with the Europeanpast. The coexistence of diverse ways of producing and transmitting knowledge is eliminated because now all forms of human knowledge are ordered on an epistemological scale from the traditional to the modern, from barbarism to civilization, from the community to the individual, from the orient to the occident. Mignolo points out that this colonial strategy of producing silences and absences belongs to the ‘dark(er) side’ of modernity. By way of this strategy, scientific thought positions itself as the only valid form of producing knowledge, and Europe acquires an epistemological hegemony over all the other cultures of the world (Castro-Gómez 2005).</p>
								<p>Now we can return to the question, why do H/N show only the postmodern side of <span class="importantword">Empire</span>, without consideration of its ‘dark(er) side’? Mignolo’s answer is consistent with his previous work. As coloniality is the ‘other face’ constitutive of modernity, postcoloniality is the structural counterpart of post-modernity. But H/N only talk about the ‘postmodern’ face of <span class="importantword">Empire</span>, ignoring its postcolonial manifestation. In this way, the structural heterogeneity is newly eliminated, privileging an Eurocentric vision of <span class="importantword">Empire</span>:</p>
								<p><span class="importantword">Empire</span> is postmodern in the sense that modernity is transformed along with the transformation of coloniality. This step is not given by Hardt and Negri because to them postcoloniality is a phenomenon that is derivative (and not constitutive) of postmodernity. Their argument leads to the conclusion that for them, postcoloniality means overcoming or the end of coloniality. They do not think or suggest that postcoloniality is the hidden side of postmodernity (as coloniality is the hidden side of modernity), and in this sense, what postcoloniality means is not the end of coloniality but its reorganization. Therefore the postcolonial would be the new and up-to-date forms of coloniality that correspond to the postmodern stage of Occidental history. (Mignolo 2002, p. 228)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
								<p>Mignolo’s argument- correct in my judgment - is that H/N outline a genealogy of <span class="importantword">Empire</span> that does not take into account the structural heterogeneity of modernity. To them, modernity is a European phenomenon that later ‘extends’ to the rest of the world in the form of colonialism. In this way, for example, the authors begin the genealogy of <span class="importantword">Empire</span> saying that everything begins in Europe, between the year 1200 and 1600 (Hardt &amp; Negri 2001, p. 104).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Here it is clearly shown that for H/N, modernity gestates completely inside Europe and develops successively by way of Intra- European phenomena like the Renaissance, the Enlightenment and the creation of the modern State, the industrial revolution, etc., until modernity reaches its postmodern crisis in <span class="importantword">Empire</span>. What happens in the rest of the world, outside of Europe, only interests H/N in that they consider the expansion of the sovereignty of the modern State outside of European borders.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Their point of reference, therefore is Europe and not the world-system, and is the reason why they see the ‘humanistic revolution’ only from its modern side, without recognizing its ‘colonial face’. What Mignolo calls ‘the dark side of the Renaissance’ continues to be invisible to them.</p>
								<p>But what would happen if the genealogy of <span class="importantword">Empire</span> took the economic world as its point of reference rather than the thinking and action of a few renowned men and European cultural movements? Mignolo points out what would occur: it would be impossible to disregard the structural heterogeneity of the economic world. If the genealogy of <span class="importantword">Empire</span> began with the rise of the world economy in the sixteenth century, then not only would we have a precise date of birth (12 October 1492) but also a specific scheme of functioning: the mutual dependence of coloniality and modernity. H/N however cannot take this step because it would seriously compromise their thesis that the ‘humanistic revolution’ of the XV and sixteenth centuries in Europe was a constituent social phenomenon. On the contrary, the thesis of Mignolo, Quijano and Dussel is that the humanism of the Renaissance was, first and foremost, a world phenomenon (and not European) because it unfolded inside the world-system, and second because it was a constituted <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> because its ‘line of escape’ was established in opposition to the theological culture of the European Middle Ages but not against <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>. No revolutionary ‘plane of inmance’ was established in the sixteenth century as H/N propose, but the substitution of a plane of local transcendence for a plane of world transcendence.</p>
								<p>The silencing of this ‘dark side of the Renaissance’ in the genealogy of <span class="importantword">Empire</span> has grave analytical consequences. The first, outlined by Mignolo is that coloniality is considered a phenomenon derived from the sovereignty of the modern nation-state. And this interpretation leads to another that is even more problematic: once the sovereignty of the modern nation-state is put in crisis by globalization and the post-fordist economy, colonialism ceased to exist. <span class="importantword">Empire</span> will mean the ‘end’ of colonialism because the devices of normalization and representation associated with the modern State are no longer necessary for the reproduction of capital. On the contrary, if one takes the economy world of the sixteenth century as a point of reference to outline the genealogy of <span class="importantword">Empire</span>, then you can no longer affirm that coloniality is a derivation of State, but a phenomenon constitutive of modernity as such. And this interpretation leads to another, which is the interpretation I will defend in the next section: <span class="importantword">Empire</span> will not bring the end of coloniality but its postmodern reorganization. This imperialistic reorganization of coloniality is the other side (invisible to H/N) that <span class="importantword">Empire</span> needs for its consolidation.</p>
								<p>In summary, we can therefore say that the creators of the concept <span class="importantword">Empire</span> have a eurocentric vision of the concept that fails to recognize its colonial devices.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The ‘missing chapter of <span class="importantword">Empire</span>’ would have to elaborate a non-eurocentric genealogy to allow a critique of the new (postmodern) forms of coloniality. In the following, I will try to trace an outline of what such a critique might look like. Using the same concept of <span class="importantword">Empire</span> created by H/N, I will show how coloniality does not disappear in postmodern <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>, but is reorganized in a postcolonial way.</p>
								<h3 id="the-postcoloniality-of-power">The (post)coloniality of power</h3>
								<p>The question I want to answer in this final part is the following: what happens in the moment in which immaterial production -no longer the material production associated with industrialization - is placed at the center of the politics of development?</p>
								<p>I want to show how the concept of <span class="importantword">Empire</span> proposed by H/N is useful in specifying exactly what the change produced in the concept of development consists of. But this diagnostic should be complimented with what in this work I call ‘the missing chapter of <span class="importantword">Empire</span>’. The diagnostic that H/N offer is incomplete because they do not take into account one of the fundamental aspects of imperialistic power, recognizing its ‘postcolonial face’. In effect, of all the structural changes that the authors analyze with great insight in their book (modern to postmodern sovereignty, imperialism to <span class="importantword">Empire</span>, the Fordist to the post-Fordist economy, the disciplinary society to the society of control, etc.) there is one that stands out by its very absence: the change from coloniality to postcoloniality. I want to show what this change consists of, taking as an example the new global agendas of sustainable development.</p>
								<p>During the sixties and the seventies, the nation-states, supported by studies in the social sciences and especially economics defined development of Third World countries in reference to the indicators of industrialization. It was assumed that development depended on the promotion of industry, in such a way that underdevelopment necessarily corresponded to a pre-industrial stage of history. Overcoming underdevelopment was equated with promoting the take off of the industrial sector. It was believed that promoting industry would result in an increase in per capita income and improvement in the indices of literacy, education, life expectancy, etc. To the developmentalists, the call for promoting the transition from ‘traditional’ society to ‘modern’ society because they assumed that modernization, is a rehearsal of the old colonial idea according to which underdevelopment was an inferior phase to full development. Development and underdevelopment are two Western ideas. Thus, promoting modernization became the central objective of the Asian, African and Latin American States during these decades. In this context, state intervention was made urgent in key sectors like health, education, family planning, urbanization and rural development. All of this was part of a strategy designed by the state to create industrial enclaves that permitted a gradual elimination poverty and ‘to bring development’ to all sectors of society. The underdeveloped populations of the Third World were seen in this way as an object of planning and the agent of this biopolitical planning should be the state. The function of the state was to eliminate obstacles to development, that is to say eradicate, or in the best of cases discipline, all those whose profiles of subjectivity, cultural traditions and ways of knowing would not adjust to the imperatives of industrialization.</p>
								<p>However, the Colombian anthropologist Arturo Escobar has shown that beginning in the 1980s, the idea of industrial development weakened and was replaced by another idea: sustainable development. According to Escobar,</p>
								<p>It seems the idea of development is loosing part of its strength. Its incapacity to carry out its promises, together with resistance from many social movements and many communities is weakening its powerful image; the authors of critical studies try to give form to this social and epistemological weakening of development by way of their analyses. You could argue that if [industrial] development is losing its push, it is because it is no longer indispensable to the globalization strategies of capital. (Escobar 1999, p. 128)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
								<p>According to Escobar, capital is undergoing a significant change in its form and is gradually acquiring a postmodern face (Escobar 2004, p. 382). This means that certain aspects once considered residual variables of modern developmentalism (like the biodiversity of the planet, the conservation of the environment, and the importance of non-occidental systems of knowing) now become central elements of the global politics of development. For Escobar, ‘sustainable development’ is nothing more than the postmodern restructuring of modern development. This means that economic development is no longer measured by the material levels of industrialization, but in terms of the capacity of a society to generate and preserve human capital. While the development theories of the sixties and seventies only took into account the ‘physical capital’ (industrialized products) and the exploitation of ‘natural capital’ (primary resources), sustainable development places the generation of ‘human capital’ at the center of its concerns, that is to say the promotion of the knowledge, aptitudes and experiences that convert a social actor into an economically productive subject.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In this way, the possibility of converting human knowledge into a productive force, replacing physical work and machines, becomes the key ingredient of sustainable development.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
								<p>H/N’s reflections also point in this direction. For them, hegemonic production is no longer centered on material work, that is to say hegemonic production is no longer based in the industrial sector and its disciplinary apparatuses. The hegemonic strength of work today does not comprise material workers but agents capable of producing and administering knowledge and information. In other words, the new type of work with strength in global <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> is defined by its ‘capacity to manipulate symbols’. This not only means that computers and new information technologies form an integral part of the labor activities of millions of people the world over, and that familiarity with these technologies of communication is a fundamental requisite for access to employment. It also means that the model for the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>ing of symbols characteristic of communication technologies is becoming the hegemonic model for the production of capital. According to this model, the capitalist economy is being reorganized today based on the knowledge that sciences like molecular biology, genetic engineering, and immunology produce, as well as the knowledge that types of research like the human genome, artificial intelligence and biotechnology produce. For H/N and Escobar, postmodern <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> is a biopolitical regime in the sense that it constructs both nature and bodies through a series of biopractices where it turns out knowledge is fundamental.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
								<p>Sustainable development is a good example of the way in which the capitalist economy is reorganized in a postmodern way. If we start from the assumption that information and knowledge are the basis of the new global economy (and no longer the industrial production controlled by the State), then the lack of access to those resources becomes the key factor in explaining underdevelopment. It is not in vain that Chapter 40 of Agenda 21 signed in Rio de Janeiro within the framework of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (1992),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> establishes that ‘in sustainable development, each person is at once a user and a carrier of information’. This means that the State is no longer the principle agent of the changes that drive economic development. The agents are now the social actors themselves, by way of their appropriation of the cognitive resources that would allow the promotion of an economy centered in information and knowledge. To be sustainable, economic growth should be capable of generating ‘human capital’, which means improving knowledge, expertise and the ability to manage social actors in order to use them more efficiently. The theorem of sustainable development can thus be formulated in the following way: without the generation of ‘human capital’, it will not be possible to overcome poverty because of the increasing knowledge gap between some countries and others. According to this theorem, a country could develop only when it learns to utilize and protect its intellectual assets because such assets are now the driving forces in an economy based on knowledge.</p>
								<p>The centrality of knowledge in the global economy and in imperialistic politics of development is made more evident when we examine the subject of the environment. Beginning with the Conference in Rio already mentioned, the environment becomes the backbone of sustainable development. It was at the conference where this Conference that The Agreement on Biological Diversity was signed, obligating signatory nations to protect their genetic resources given that now genetic resources were considered part of the ‘common heritage of mankind’. The United Nations’ interest in the conservation and management if this ‘heritage’ is clear: genetic resources have economic value and mean benefits for those businesses that work with the latest technologies in the areas of biotechnology and genetic engineering. In this way, the handling of information and abstract languages —what H/N call ‘immaterial production’ —is placed at the center of the capitalist, postmodern business.</p>
								<p>In effect, the identification, alteration and transference of genetic material by way of knowledge have economic applications in the fields of agriculture and health. In the agricultural sector, biotechnology works by incrementing the production of food by means of the production of transgenic plants that are most resistant to plagues and insects, and less vulnerable to chemical fumigation. In 1999, 90 percent of the soya beans produced in Argentina and 33 percent of the corn produced in the United States originate from transgenic crops, and that percentage is even higher for products like cotton, tomatoes, tobacco, sugar cane, asparagus, strawberries, papaya, kiwi, barley, cucumber and zucchini. The biotechnological transformation of agriculture is a profitable business for the food industry and is controlled by a handful of businesses specialized in biotechnical research. The same occurs in the health sector. The pharmaceutical industry is concentrated in the production of medicines with a biological basis that are used in the treatment of illnesses like cancer, hemophilia, and hepatitis B, not to mention the growing production of generic medication and pharmaceutical drugs. It is estimated that the market for medication derived from plant extracts or biological products generates profits that hover around four hundred thousand million dollars annually, earnings that are concentrated in the hands of a small number of multinational businesses that monopolize ground-breaking research.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
								<p>Therefore, the subject of biodiversity places us at the forefront of a strategic sector of the global economy that will certainly redefine the geopolitics of the twenty-first century because access to genetic information will determine the difference between success and economic failure. Multinational corporations are interested in genetic resources that can be altered and manipulated by expert knowledge. Interestingly enough the greatest diversity is found in countries located in the South, the underdeveloped countries. For this reason, these businesses have initiated a real ‘lobbying’ campaign to obtain patents for these resources, appealing to intellectual property rights (CDI). Before the Uruguayan round of the GATT<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> in 1993, no transnational legislation existed that pertained to intellectual property rights. Multinational businesses like Bristol Myers, DuPont, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck and Pfizer, with vested interests in the biodiversity business, pressured for the introduction of the TRIP<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> accord into the negotiations. This agreement permits the monopolistic control of the planet’s genetic resources by businesses.</p>
								<p>Intellectual Property is a juridical concept with a transnational scope. It is protected by the United Nations through the OMPI (World Intellectual Property Organization), which protects and regulates the ‘creations and innovations of the human intellect’, such as artistic and scientific works.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> According to this norm, when immaterial products involve some type of technological innovation that has commercial application, they can be patented by their authors and used as if they were private property.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> A patent is defined as the concession that the State grants to an inventor so he can commercially exploit his product in an exclusive way, for a certain amount of time. In the case of biodiversity and genetic resources, multinational corporations that work with the latest technologies can legitimately claim that any genetic alteration of the flora and fauna implies an inventive activity of the intellect that has a direct application in the agricultural or pharmaceutical industries, and therefore they are rightfully protected by patents. By claiming that genetically modified biological material is no longer a product of nature but of human intellect, the multinationals claim the right to patent and declare as their own the economic benefits from the commercialization of these products. Legitimated in this way by a supranational juridical regime, the intellectual assets administered by multinational corporations are converted into the key sector for the creation of wealth in postmodern <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>.</p>
								<p>But it is precisely here where the ‘postcolonial face’ of <span class="importantword">Empire</span> is revealed. I am talking about the ways in which new representations of development reinforce the modern/colonial hierarchies in a postmodern register, establishing a difference between the valid knowledge of some, and the non-knowledge or doxa of the others. One example of this is the way in which global agendas of sustainable development approach the subject of ‘traditional knowledge’. Multinational corporations are aware that by association with biodiversity and genetic resources, traditional knowledge and its ‘officials’ acquire a fabulous economic potential and represent numerous opportunities for commercialization. It is no wonder that in 2001 the OMPI created a ‘intergovernmental committee for the protection of intellectual property, genetic resources, traditional knowledge and folklore’, and that in 2003 UNESCO declared that ‘...communities, in particular indigenous communities, play an important role in the production, safeguarding, maintenance and recreation of the intangible cultural heritage, thus helping to enrich cultural diversity and human <span class="importantword">creativity</span>’.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The ‘safeguarding’ of traditional knowledge, now transformed into the ‘guarantors of sustainable development’, does not come for free. What is sought is to put a whole series of knowledges used for hundreds of years, by hundreds of communities world-wide at the disposal of multinationals specialized in research on genetic resources. These knowledges become susceptible to appropriation by multinational corporations through patents. Naturally, this requires a change in the representations of the other. What does this change consist of?</p>
								<p>We know that in the modern paradigm of development, non-occidental systems were seen as the enemies of progress. It was assumed that industrialization created the conditions to leave behind a type of knowledge based in myths and superstitions, replacing it with the technical-scientific knowledge of modernity. It was also believed that personal traits like passivity, lack of discipline and indolence, associated perhaps to defects of race, depended rather on the ‘absence of modernity’. The absence of modernity could be overcome in the same way that the State resolves structural problems like illiteracy and poverty. In this way, the modern paradigm of development was also a colonial paradigm. ‘Other’ knowledges had to be disciplined or excluded.</p>
								<p>However, and as H/N see it, postmodern <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> is presented as a machine of segmentary inclusions, not of exclusions. Non-occidental knowledge is welcomed by the global agendas of <span class="importantword">Empire</span> because it is useful to the capitalist project of biodiversity. The tolerance of cultural diversity has become a ‘politically correct’ value in <span class="importantword">Empire</span>, but only in the sense that diversity is useful for the reproduction of capital. The indigenous person, for example, is no longer seen as someone pertaining to the social, economic and cognitive past of humanity, but as the ‘guardian of biodiversity’ (Ulloa, 2004). Once considered obstacles to a nation’s economic development, the indigenous are now seen as indispensable to the sustainable development of the world. Traditional knowledge is elevated to the category of ‘the intangible heritage of humanity’. Arturo Escobar formulates it in this way:</p>
								<p>Once the semiotic conquest of nature is complete, the sustainable and rational use of the environment becomes imperative. Here is found the underlying logic of the discourses of sustainable development and biodiversity. This new capitalization of nature not only rests on the semiotic conquest of territories (in terms of biodiversity reserves) and communities (as the ‘guardians’ of nature); it also requires the semiotic conquest of local knowledges, in the sense that ‘saving nature’ requires the valuation of local wisdom about the sustainability of nature. Modern biology begins to discover that local systems of knowledge are useful complements. (Escobar 2004, pp. 383-384)</p>
								<p>The point that we want to emphasize is that the ‘semiotic conquest’ mentioned by Escobar re-signifies the colonial and modern mechanisms that legitimated the exclusion of ‘other’ knowledges in a postmodern form. It is in this sense that we talk about the postcolonial face of postmodernity. The ‘recognition’ that is given to non-occidental systems of knowledge is pragmatic rather than epistemical. Although the wisdom of indigenous communities or black communities can now be seen as ‘useful’ for the conservation of the environment, the categorical distinction between ‘traditional knowledge’ and ‘science’, elaborated in the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century, is still in force. The former continues to be seen as anecdotal knowledge, not quantitative and lacking methodology, while the later continues, in spite of the transdisciplinary efforts of the last decades, to be taken as the only epistemically valid knowledge. Not a single document of global entities like UNESCO questions this assumption. On the contrary, the document of the OMPI titled Intellectual Property and Traditional Knowledge establishes that traditional knowledge is tied to ‘folkloric expressions’ such as songs, narratives and graphic designs, reproducing the classic distinction between doxa and episteme. In no part of the document is a dialogue between occidental science and local wisdom proposed. No dialogue between a biologist trained at Harvard and a shaman from Putumayo is possible, only what amounts to a ‘transfer’ of knowledge in one direction. In this way, all that is sought is to document the doxa and preserve it (according to what is established by the Agreement on Biological Diversity signed in 1992) so that it can later be patented.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
								<p>The praxis of multinational corporations is a clear example of how we have not reached the ‘end of colonialism’ as H/N declare, but that colonialism reformulates itself in a postmodern way. Firstly, research in genetic engineering is very expensive. For that reason, a small number of companies from the richest countries in the world dominate the field, while their ‘object of study’, the biological wealth of the earth, is concentrated the poor nations of the subtropical and tropical regions of the world. It is estimated that more than 4/5 of the biological diversity of the planet is found in regions that used to be called ‘Third World’. Colombia, surpassed only by Brazil, is the second most biodiverse country in the world. More species of amphibians, mammals and birds exist there than in any other nation. For the above reasons, supranational entities like the OMPI and regional treaties like the TLC are intended to eliminate national-level protections of biodiversity and open the door to big pharmaceutical and agribusiness corporations so they can move forward with research and, patent the genetic resources contained in natural products. All this of course is with the help of local communities according to those who look to seduce local communities with the promise of a share in the earnings from the sale of traditional knowledge. For this however, a patent is required that would allow those companies to control the knowledge and resources generated by this faboulous business. Indeed, 95 percent of the biological patents are controlled by five big biotechnical companies, and the earnings produced by the issuing of patents was fifteen thousand million dollars in 1990.</p>
								<p>The patents are the juridical mechanism by which new forms of colonial expropriation of knowledge are legitimated. Vandana Shiva mentions the case of a bioprospecting contract between a conservationist institute from Costa Rica and the pharmaceutical multinational Merck in 1991. Merck, with earnings of four thousand million dollars a year and close to three thousand share-holders from all over the world, paid the ridiculously low sum of one million dollars to Costa Rica for the exclusive right to investigate, collect samples and catalogue the genetic resources in a number of Costa Rica’s national parks. This was done without consulting or soliciting the opinion of the indigenous communities that live in that region, and without guaranteeing them any sort of benefit. According to Shiva, the market for the medicinal plants discovered and patented by Merck, but facilitated by the indigenous communities and locals, is estimated today at some 43 thousand million dollars. Something similar occurs with the Free Trade Agreement (Tratado de Libre Comercio), which requires that countries rich in biodiversity like those of the Andean region provide legal guarantees for the implementation of ‘biological corridors’ where multinationals can appropriate genes and the ancestral knowledge of the population. In this way, and in signing the Agreement as proposed by the United States, the market for products derived from biodiversity and associated knowledge would stay under the monopolistic control of a handful of companies.</p>
								<p>Therefore, we have argued that postmodern <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>, based in the production of knowledge, has converted biodiversity into the new ‘green gold’ of the Indies. H/N’s thesis that there is no ‘outside of <span class="importantword">Empire</span>’ does not mean that all geographical territories have already been colonized by the market economy, and that therefore the era of colonialism has ended. It means, better yet, that capital now needs to find posterritorial colonies to continue its <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of expansion. These new colonies, even if they continue to be seated in the old territories of modern colonialism, they no longer reproduce the same logic of that colonialism. Its logic is rather of a post-Fordist type, because it is no longer material riches that they seek, but information contained in the genes and in non-occidental systems of knowledge. It is for this reason that they no longer look to destroy but to preserve traditional wisdom, despite the fact they still see them as epistemically devalued forms. Now the ‘value’ given to the work of local communities has no material measure as in modern colonialism, but is measured in immaterial terms. Their work and their culture have value as long as they serve to produce ‘sustainable knowledge’. However, this knowledge is expropriated by the new logic of <span class="importantword">Empire</span>.</p>
								<p>It is surprising then that H/N declare the death of colonialism so assuredly, in spite of being aware of this problem. Consider for example the following passage taken from the book Multitude:</p>
								<p>The global North is genetically poor in plant varieties and yet it holds the vast majority of the patents: while the global South is rich in species, but poor in patents. What is more, many of the patents in the power of the North are derived for the genetic primary material that is found in the species of the South. The wealth of the North generates benefits in the form of private property, while the wealth of the South does not generate any wealth because it is considered the heritage of all humanity. (Hardt &amp; Negri 2004, pp. 216-217)</p>
								<p>But instead of considering bioproperty as a form of postmodern reorganization of coloniality, H/N prefer to engage with hegemony of immaterial work. Nonetheless, the step from Fordist to post-Fordist production that is emphasized by H/N does not only mean that immaterial production obtains hegemony over material production. It means, above all else, that we are entering a type of world economy that is no longer based entirely on mineral resources, but increasingly in plant and biological resources. Forty percent of all productive <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es today are based in biological materials and the tendency is growing. This means that without the genetic resources located in the poor regions of the South, and without the premeditated expropriation of non-occidental systems of knowledge, the post-Fordist economy of <span class="importantword">Empire</span> would not be possible. For this reason we declare that the colonialism of power has not died, but has only changed form. This does not mean that the strictly modern forms of coloniality have disappeared, but that other forms have appeared that share an affinity with the new imperatives of immaterial production.</p>
								<p>Returning then to the question that opened this work, is there only one world, or are there various possible worlds? It would have to be said that the conditions generated by <span class="importantword">Empire</span>, the colonial hierarchies of knowledge established by modernity, persist and make it difficult to think of a world in which epistemic plurality is recognized and appreciated. <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> is a machine that captures the proliferation of possible worlds and expropriates the production of ‘other’ knowledges. For this reason, the multitude that H/N herald with such optimism is not possible or thinkable without an epistemical democracy in which science stops being a slave of <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> and the diverse forms of producing and transmitting knowledge can coexist and complement each other. I am referring to a world in which non-occidental systems of knowledge can be incorporated into the curriculums of occidental universities on equal terms in areas like law, medicine, biology, economy and philosophy. A world in which for example the Yoruba cosmovision, the Buddhist cosmovision of Zen, or the cosmovision of the Cuna Indians, can serve to advance towards a more integral science, more organic, more centered in the common good rather than in the needs of capital. Perhaps then and only then, can we move forward towards a world in which many other worlds would be possible.</p>

<span class="author">Jonhatan Beller</span><span class="words"> | 2.105 words | <a href="#"><span class="importantword">creativity</span></a>, <a href="#">Capital</a>, <a href="#">Abstraction</a></span>								<p><b>Portions of this essay were originally published as &quot;Wagers Within the Image: Rise of Visuality, Transformation of Labour, Aesthetic Regimes&quot; in Culture Machine, vol. 12, 2012; http://www.culturemachine.net</b></p>
								<p>Let us examine a few consequences of the industrialization of the visual. As IPO after IPO seem to demonstrate, to look is to labor: looking itself is posited as value-productive labor. We know this now. In the cinematic mode of production this generalizes to what I called ‘the attention theory of value’.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Today, after the internet revolution (or, perhaps equally, counter-revolution), this relation between screen-time and social production is increasingly pre-supposed. Of course the energy levels, control modules and digitized metrics of interactivity have been vertiginously intensified. Here we must remark that with the digitization of the screen as socio-biological interface, with the ramification of both its functionality and the intensive development of a metrics of attention, the stock prices of media companies such as Google are what they are because they are exploits: schemas for the expropriation of value produced by the users (and therefore the used). Early dot.com markets picked up on this shift before it was widely understood. Today, this arrangement of screen-cybernetics along with an increasingly precise metrics of attention has its sights on nearly every aspect of lived and to-be-lived time, even those forms of time that are engaged in organized struggle against capitalist forms of domination. As has been remarked, the perception of Facebook’s and Twitter’s future monetization potential increases with every ‘Twitter revolution’: unrest in Tunisia, Cairo, Madrid and New York become bankable events for new media corporations in ways at once departing from but analogous to what news has long been for print and television.</p>
								<p>This interface between spectator and social machinery, realized as ‘the image’ (which received rigorous critical analysis by the Frankfurt School, the situationists (Debord) and feminist film theory), has been generalized to the omnipresent screen and is also being extended to the other platforms and senses: ‘the computer,’ ‘the tablet,’ and ‘the cellphone’ – all of which appear increasingly similar. Now, of course, the programme is being extended to sound, smell, touch and taste – music and game sounds, obviously, but also programmed shopping environments (which themselves extend into the urban fabric) organized by architecture, texture, scent, and arguably salt, sugar and fat. These innovations and their convergence (towards the omnipresent, omnivorous and indeed omniscient cyber-spatialized mall-military-prison-post-industrial cosmopoplex) bring about new levels of interactivity as well as new and ever more elaborate metrics for the organization and parsing of attention-production.</p>
								<p>Such a transformation of the role of visuality, sensuality and their media technologies in social production and reproduction necessitated the formulation of the above mentioned attention theory of value, which reduces to the labor theory of value at sub-light (sub-cinematic) speeds but allows value formations to persist for a while in the electronic matrix in non-monetized forms. The theory posits that attention produces value in at least three ways:</p>
								<p>1. Attention valorizes media bytes and pathways in ways that can be monetized – paintings, films, war propaganda, advertisements; and monetized on spec: Yahoo, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Groupon (these are all forms of expropriation through privatization of the commons). While there are various levels and/or strategies for the valorization of attentional labor (from ticket sales, to the sale of advertising, to the IPO), what needs to be remarked upon is the still intensifying capitalist ramification of the domain of the visual and, more generally, the sensual. This domain (remember the shared institution called privacy?), formerly part of the commons, is now pitted, furrowed and trolled by the avatars of private entities bent upon the capture of formerly extra-economic activities: from accessing water, to looking around, to thought. The extent of this transformation that amalgamates attention with privately owned mediation has completely reorganized the logistics of perception, along with the mental functions that have perception as their basis (which is to say all conscious, and arguably the majority of unconscious <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es, including language-function) on a planetary scale.</p>
								<p>2. Thus we can say that the techno-economic shifts marked by cinema and its legacy technologies utilize attention to retool spectators, reworking on a minute-by-minute basis forms of social know-how, of needs, of semiotic and affective capacities, and demanding a constant revamping of ‘the soul’ (or of soullessness – as the case often seems to be). Workers, prosumers, playborers and those described by Flusser in a different context as ‘functionaries’ (those who work within the programme of the camera) ready themselves and are thereby readied for the developing exigencies of the market.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
								<p>3. Over time visuo-attentional transformations as indexed by emerging media technologies reorganize (i.e., reprogramme) language-function along with the imaginary and performativity such that the daily retoolings can be dialectically incorporated into or functionalized by the daily advances in technical interfaces. Althusserian ‘know-how,’ the capacity to work for capital produced in schools and other ‘ideological state apparatuses’,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> receives ever more penetrating and subtle elaboration through the techno- capitalist capture of the ‘cognitive-linguistic.’ It thus participates in what Virno, giving new life to a term from Marx, effectively identifies as the subsumption of ‘the general intellect’.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In a recent remark, Zizek has noted that what Bill Gates accomplished with proprietary software was the privatization of part of the general intellect, which we now rent.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The result is that privatized media are omnipresent in the praxis of consciousness, never more than a couple of interfaces away from any and all attentional practices, such that attention to any aspect of life becomes a form of production in the social factory of <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>.</p>
								<p>Most of these relations discussed above could be, and indeed were, derived, in one form or another, pre-internet: they were already inherent in cinema and television, even though they have become fully manifest only in the so-called digital age. However, given that capital itself imposed a relentless digitization of life beginning in the fifteenth century, it is more accurate to think of today’s ‘digital revolution’ as Digitality 2.0. These relations of communication and social cooperation were therefore incipient in the first digital revolution, that of capital itself.</p>
								<p>Thus, early in the twentieth century, one could already see that the extension of media pathways was, in fact, the further ramification of the life-world by capital-logic. The communist revolutionary filmmakers marked capital’s encroachment on the visual as a site of struggle; Third Cinema (the cinema of decolonization), in Solanas’ and Getino’s manifesto, famously asserted that for the purposes of colonialism Hollywood was more effective than napalm (2000). Today the habitation of the senses by the logic of capitalized visuality is widespread, structuring desire, performance, perception and self-perception on a world scale, even in the most unlikely of places. For example, a recent essay by Danny Hoffman entitled ‘Violent Virtuosity: Visual Labour in West Africa’s Mano River War’ argues that the spectacular crimes against others in the region are precisely that: spectacles of maiming and mass murder designed to garner attention in a world-media system (which includes broadcast news, the internet and the U.N.) that rewards Africa for specific kinds of self-production.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> As Hoffman demonstrates through a close analysis of photographic and videographic materials, ‘This was a war structured by the economy of attention. To profit in this economy, combatants and non- combatants were required to play to an audience that they knew was there, but often could only sense or apprehend in the most abstract way’.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Although this should be obvious it bears emphasizing: just because there is no computer in the room does not mean that one escapes its programme.</p>
								<p>One sees two significant factors in this global distribution of the logistics of the image-interface: first, that the struggle for attention is a struggle for existence at many levels. And second, that restricting ourselves to categories that are marked only as politico-economic ones does not allow us to resolve the specific aspects of this struggle. Very simply, race, gender, nationality and other ‘socio-historical’ categories must therefore be thought in their economic determinations within (and in excess of) the attention economy.</p>
								<h3 id="within-the-image-the-system-of-global-apartheid">Within the Image / The System of Global Apartheid</h3>
								<p>The increasing power of visual and digital media gave rise to new forms of cultural imperialism (which, in case there was ever any doubt, is actually real imperialism by other or additional means). Martin Jay has identified various ‘scopic regimes of modernity,’ Regis Debray analyses the emergence of what he calls the ‘videosphere’ which overtakes the ‘logosphere’ in the 19th century and Nick Mirzoeff in The Right to Look identifies complexes of visuality spanning the plantation (1660-1865), imperialism (1857-1947), and military industrialism (1945-present, Mirzoeff’s periodizations).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> We can clearly grasp from this intensification of the visual (however periodized and parsed) that capital targets not just territory but also consciousness, visual relations and the imagination itself in its struggle to organize production – which is to say, value-productive labor, and therefore corporeal performance. Capital’s geographical expansion outwards is accompanied by a corporeal corkscrewing inward. Therefore, the visual, the cultural, the imaginal and the digital – as the de/re- terriorialization of plantation and factory dressage, Protestant ethics, manners and the like – are functionalized as gradients of control over production and necessarily therefore of struggle. This struggle for shares of social wealth is at once over images and within images.</p>
								<p>The movement from print and semiotics to visuality and affect, which could broadly be said to characterize the current politico- economic transition from the paradigm of the factory to that of the social factory, dialectically produces the increasing slippage of the signifier from the signified. This slippage and the consequent vanishing of the Real should be historicized and thus understood as a result of the penetration of the life-world by images; the increasing gap between signifier and signified indexes technical degrees of social cyberneticization and real subsumption. In historical order, linguistics, psychoanalysis, semiotics, deconstruction, postmodernism, virtual reality and reality-TV are all symptoms and accommodations of the scrambling of traditional language function by the intensification and increasing omnipresence of images. As argued in <em>The Cinematic Mode of Production</em>, the rise of late- 19th and 20th century humanistic disciplines can be characterized by innovations in their treatment of language and therefore can be used to index or periodize the quantitative intensification of visuality.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Each intensification of the disruption of linguistic function by images along with the consequent denaturing of ‘natural’ language requires a new discipline capable of negotiating a receding Real; the sheer quantity of visual <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>ing required by techno-<span class="importantword">capitalism</span> inaugurates changes in the qualities of thought. The linguistic commons along with its ability to slow down images and configure the Real is put under siege by visual and then digital culture. This siege results in a continuous and radical re-programming of the cognitive-linguistic. The structure, functions and capacities of words themselves today bear the mark of digitization. Though this hypothesis remains to be demonstrated in detail, we might glean from the mutations in the form of literature during modernity and post-modernity the breadth and consequences of such transformations. A line drawn from the fragmentation of narrative at the turn of the 20th century to the veritable demise of English departments at the turn of the 21st pretty much tells the recent story of language’s purchase on the world. If we were serious about taking the measure of linguistic decay, the withering of the Real, the absolute failure of semiotics and, more generally, of representation we could ruefully add to the evidence the 2012 U.S. Republican primary debates.</p>
								<p>If capital expands through the development of visuality and the consequences of visuality include the evisceration, or at the very least, the reprogramming of linguistic capacity, then it is clear that socio-historical categories, themselves nothing other than the organization and semioticization of appearances, are also economic ones. While there is significant work tracking the interpenetration of economic vectors and those of race, nation and gender, disappointingly, it has also been possible for a self-identified leftist political economy to view racial and gendered formations as somehow epiphenomenal. This is a political as well as an analytical error. ‘Race’ and ‘gender’, which is to say race and gender as such, are from (at least) the early modern period onward ineluctably tied to scopic regimes and therefore to economic ones. In other words, these dynamics are constitutive of technologies themselves. Thus it is incorrect to just state, for example, that photography objectifies women or racial minorities. Rather, one has to see the social role of the media platform as also constitutive of the platform. What photography ‘is’ has everything to do with its social functions, meaning that the objectification of women is part of what photography is, and the legacies of colonialism and slavery are embedded in its history and technical form.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Otherwise, one grasps a platform fetishistically, as a reification of social relations. IBM developed the punch card to cross-reference German populations for Nazis looking for Jews, gypsies and homosexuals during the Holocaust and this development was a precursor to modern computing.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The social function is embedded in the machine, just as the role of computation in financialization and in the organizing of labor practices in China is also part of the meaning of the computer. Race and gender are endemic to technological form and technological form is endemic to political economy. To argue otherwise is to engage in technological determinism and fetishistic abstraction.</p>
								<p>The investor consolidation of major industrial media platforms, from photography through cinema, video, reality-TV (which, for a decade at least, has made the hyphen between ‘reality’ and ‘TV’ mandatory) and the ambient computer is to be understood in part as a series of endeavors to profitably manage the transformed and transforming situation of language, race and gender vis-à-vis real transformations in techno-social mediations. Here we might identify four fundamental visual media shifts along with their disciplinary consequences: the visual marking and promulgation of race and gender differences alongside modern sociology (Stage 1: the art of photo-graphy); Hollywood’s splicings of black musical talent onto white faces and the generalization of montage alongside psychoanalytic attention to language’s break-down products and the dream as rebus (Stage 2: the rise of cinema); the promulgation of a mythically all-white, consumerist world bent on denying racism and imperialism on U.S. television alongside deconstruction’s placing of the signified, experience, the Real and ‘being’ under erasure (Stage 3: television/video); the emergence of virtuality alongside the imperative to virtuosity (Stage 4: digitality). Taken together these periodized clusters assemble techniques of subjectivity, of profitably re-mounting a worker-subject able to function in a political economy characterized by the long movement of value extraction from the scene of the plantation and factory floor to that of the deterritorialized factory, aka the scene of the screen and the social factory. Together these stages create the conditions of possibility for the current regime of Global Apartheid.</p>
								<p>Clarity about the reconfiguration of subjectivity, language function and of interiority by the intensification of visuality, along with the consequent recession (devaluation) of the signified (Real) vis-à-vis the inflation of the sign (image) reveals that there is not a single iteration of social form that is separable from political-economic history. This dialectic further insists that we consider the mediological basis, that is, the system of support-apparatus- procedure that Regis Debray argues underpins ‘mediological’ transmissions (in his view incorrectly identified for the better part of a century as ‘communication’), of some other recent endeavors to treat the transformation of the value form and the transformed situation of labor.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
								<p>In <span class="importantword">Empire</span>, for example, Hardt and Negri return to Marx’s idea of social cooperation as endemic to production and argue for the real subsumption of society by capital. This real subsumption is stated as a fact, but we might ask how is it accomplished? What is the material basis of subsumption? What are the media of <span class="importantword">Empire</span>? Paolo Virno (2004) has argued convincingly that capital has captured the cognitive-linguistic capacities of the species. Pointedly, he argues that we are now all virtuosos who perform speech acts in accord with ‘the score’ orchestrated by capital – this, precisely, is the operation of the general intellect. Post-Fordist production requires virtuosity for the maintenance of capital expansion. Our cognitive-linguistic abilities have been conscripted and expropriated. But again, what are the mediological conditions of possibility of post-Fordism, and what are the raced and gendered dimensions of the ‘servility’ Virno identifies?</p>
								<p>Relatedly, we also have the work of Maurizio Lazzarato (1996), Christian Marazzi (2010), Tiziana Terranova (2003) on ‘free labor’ and ‘cognitive <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>,’ providing us with a set of post- Fordist variants in which, given the sublime expansion of the financial system, virtuosos, by and large, accommodate themselves and their situations to the requisites of capitalist society in the performance of cognitive labor in a way which, according to some of these theorists, renders value immeasurable and the significance of post-Fordist input potentially undecidable.</p>
								<p>One might identify in these innovative modes of conceptualization a relatively unacknowledged debt to the apparatus theory of Louis Althusser (1971), to feminism (Kristeva 1982, Cixous, 1994, Haraway 1991) and Marxist feminism (Fortunati, 2007; Maria Mies, 1999), to de/post-colonial and critical race theory (Fanon, 2008; Spillers, 1987; Spivak, 1999), and to media theory. However, the dominant post-Marxist arguments could be more cognisant of their conditions of possibility, both in terms of the history of raced and gendered labor (the socio-political techne) that inaugurated the very changes in the mode of production being theorized, and in terms of the intellectual debts owed for their own theoretical formulations. This debt is a matter of citational politics, clearly, but not in any simple sense. These theories have been built upon the labor of long suffering communities as well as on their labor of insurrection and insurrectionary critique. For let us agree to consider it a fact that revolutionary energies large and small have advanced planetary intersubjectivity in their quest for liberation even if these same energies have been domesticated by the financialization of media platforms. We must therefore be relentlessly critical when we observe that in spite of the mass basis of mediological transformations, some critical micro-cultures now proceed as if the only people worth having a conversation with are those avid readers of Badiou and Agamben, a posture that belies the highly circumscribed standpoint of the Franco-Italian insights. This insularity, palpable to readers with roots and affinities in queer, of color, and global south communities, underscores a widespread if disavowed complicity with racism, sexism and eurocentrism in still all too Western theory.</p>
								<p>The dearth of awareness of these multiple debts and of the historicity of practices that form the new economic order of <span class="importantword">Empire</span> is least true for Terranova, who draws on feminism, cyber-feminism and critical race theory. Because of this she is sometimes wrongly perceived as being less original and innovative than her male counterparts. However, in arguing that ‘the digital economy [i]s a specific mechanism of internal “capture” of larger pools of social and cultural knowledge [and that t]he digital economy is an important area of experimentation with value and free cultural/affective labor,’ Terranova is clear that the exploit of digital <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> draws upon practices and inequalities that were ‘always and already <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>’.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In other words, for her at least, racism and sexism are embroiled in <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>, and it would seem senseless to talk about (or critique) the latter in the absence of the former.</p>
								<p>Given these observations, one should see that the concrete elements of the social: the ideological state apparatus, racial formations, the visual turn, the cultural turn, the feminization of labor and the servility and virtuosity of cognitive <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> as part of the same equation. This is one in which the capitalized image reconfigures cultural praxis as a wholesale production site in ways that impose servility and would delimit and even foreclose the emergence of practicable anti-capitalist, anti-patriarchal, anti-racist and anti- imperialist speech-acts. Material formations precisely delimit speech-acts thus, because, generally speaking, the post-Fordist attention economy still depends upon the patriarchal, white- supremacist, imperialist organization of the global imaginary to maximize returns. The ambient machines of the social, be they concrete machines (cameras, cell phones, networks) or abstract machines (races, laws, nations) are in fact real abstractions, that is, cut-n-mixable instruments available for the virtuosic configuration of social relations such that they adhere to the requisites of raced and gendered capitalist exploitation.</p>
								<p>To give but one example here of how a critique cognisant of these relations might take form, Cindy Gao (2012) examines a series of videos by Asian-American YouTube celebrities, including vlogs of NigaHiga and KevJumba, and Wong Fu’s Yellow Fever, and characterizes their practice of performing race as ‘virtuosic virtuality’.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Without essentializing identity (Gao sees the term Asian American as itself a form of virtuality), the construct ‘virtuosic virtuality’ cranks up the stakes of the virtual and suggests that, here at least, these technologically enabled performances of ethnicity are subsumed by a <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> that still requires and indeed develops the racial regimes that are the legacy of white supremacist capitalist patriarchy. Indeed Gao shows that one can investigate this subsumption without insisting that Marxism trumps critical race theory. It is rather that in making the critique of a narrowly empowering Asian-American performativity (narrow because achieved through the trafficking in gendered and racist stereotypes), anti-racist and anti-capitalist critique go together. To be a bit reductive, it is arguable that in the absence of anti-racist, anti- capitalist critique the cultural movement is inevitably towards a system of structural inequality that invents and indeed requires new forms of racism – which is precisely what is going on with many of the popular Asian-American YouTube celebrities (there are certain advances but somebody has to pay, e.g., women, South Asians); or, the movement is towards a critique of <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> that sees racism as epiphenomenal rather than constitutive and therefore uncritically replicates the racist and eurocentric assumptions of the era.</p>
								<p>Thus equipped we must confront the fact that increasingly, every ad we see, every page we browse, every email we send, every word we say, every thought we think and every dream we have is part of the production and reproduction of capitalist society – sensuous labor 2.0. The various media platforms, social categories, and imaginal iterations are one with capital and these would script our participation in order to allow capital to think in us and through us. I italicize ‘would’ here because this point is both complex and contentious and appears to be moving towards a genuine crisis. The dialectic requires that we have it both ways. On the one hand, capitalist expropriation has never lain so closely upon thought, utterance, the imagination and bodily practices – it has engineered a networked cybernetic matrix of control, an occupation that has seized the bio-social commons. Anti-racist, anti-capitalist critique is ever more difficult to launch effectively, since the general intellect, increasingly expropriated, thinks for capital. On the other hand, and without doubt, real subsumption can never be complete if it is to matter at all, which it does, if, obviously, the thoughts (and indeed the material connections to life) in, say, this essay, are to be anything more than a means by which you advance your career. And whilst non-proprietary file sharing, p2p, creative commons, copy-left, etc., are laudable endeavors, and ‘gateways’<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> that may open to a post-capitalist society, it seems premature to claim for any of these innovations that the medium is the message. For these practices at present do not contain within themselves a genuinely revolutionary critique or message (anti-racist, anti-imperialist, prison abolitionist, environmentalist, feminist, queer). It is not even clear that some of them are anti-capitalist.</p>
								<p>With our language de-fanged, our critical theory suspect, and our machines and imaginations complicit, where to turn? I suggest below that there are discursive and aesthetic dimensions to contemporary life that are incompletely explored. Here we must reconsider the third world, its legacies of survival and heritable corporeal commons and the possible non-capitalist transmission of these resources. The reconstitution of consciousness in post- Fordism materially links each to all in ever more intensive ways and raises question of solidarity, democracy and social justice in new domains. As I will show, the attention economy induces a movement from the wage to the wager, and with this shift demands an analysis of the politics of the utterance and aesthetics of survival.</p>
								<p>Experience teaches me that when discussing the logistics of the image and social production/reproduction through digital interactivity and human attention, I am obliged to add that none of these statements regarding the violence of media-<span class="importantword">capitalism</span> and its subsuming of the life-world as well as many of its ‘alternatives,’ means to say that ‘prior’ forms of exploitation that are characteristic of feudal serfdom, slavery, proletarianization, prostitution, domestic work, migrant labor, or the labor of survival in either camps or the postmodern slum have ceased to exist. Rather these persisting modes should be viewed as conditions of dispossession which are coordinated and legitimated, marginalized or made unrepresentable by the command-control apparatus of the digital-visual via a calculus of the image that enlists our for-profit participation in the capitalist military-media-prison-industrial complex. From a macro-structural point of view, human becoming is bent toward two dialectically identical ends: capital accumulation and radical dispossession. The overall result is the immeasurable violence of the world-wide suppression of democratic becoming. We participate in this totalitarian systemic practice despite the relatively clear facts that the earth is headed towards environmental catastrophe and that two billion people (the entire population of Earth in 1929) are even now laboring to survive actually existing Armageddon. Given their intimate and indeed inescapable connection to the world media- system and the attention economy, the dispossessed have thus become the living substrate of contemporary systems of representation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> We write our revolutionary tracts on the backs of slaves. Radical dispossession as the other side of a world-media system is in the most literal sense the condition of possibility for our contemporary thought and writing. It bears asking, under what image or images do the radically dispossessed labor? And also, what’s it to you?</p>
								<p>The questions I pose at this point concern the images written over and on the historically produced informatic black hole smothering the bottom two billion denizens of postmodern globality. They are questions about subalterns whom I have come to think should never be designated by the sign bare life, but, at the very least, by the sign ‘bare life,’ now in quotation marks. The quotation marks are there in order that the signifier registers its own constitutive performativity in relation to those who are being signified upon. ‘Bare life’ neither merely exists nor merely appears but by virtue of a signifying <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> – a signifying industrial complex – that codifies its messages on bodies presumed to be incapacitated and unaccommodated to such an extent that they are beyond the reach of dialogue. These bodies are thereby made to signify the limit of sociality and presumed to exist in a condition of social death. My point here is that whether it is Agamben selling philosophy books or bankers and policy-makers selling bailouts and weapons, we find bodies and populations being constituted as surfaces of inscription: bodies whose living labor of survival serves to make them fodder for philosophy, statistics, political theory, entrepreneurs, militaries, banks and states. Subalterns are actively configured as the living substrate of representation for capitalist mediation. In other words, the unceasing dis-figuration of the masses is the price of success, but the success belongs to someone else: the celebrity capitalists, militarized nations, and some of their aspirant followers. Such is the enclosure wrought by the world of technical images. Squatters, trash-pickers, illegals, displaced populations, post-modern slaves, and billions for whom we here have no names and whose deaths will not appear in any newspaper, attend to the historically imposed exigencies of life. Their attention to the world-machine of survival, their endeavors to constitute themselves in myriad ways, underpin the spectacular- digital of meaning, agency, and global citizenship. For the world- media system, subaltern survival or death is mere raw material for semiotics, affect and intensity. As threat, tragedy, irrational irruption or non-entity, entire populations are bundled and sold, converted into semiotic and affective chits for capital’s master-gamers.</p>
								<p>We must register the violence endemic to the conversion of historically dispossessed others into images and signs – in addition to objects (a concern central to the work of the young urban photo- graffiti artist JR) – because in being figured as bare life, multitudes, refugees, tribes, slum-dwellers, or terrorists, and even when not being figured at all, the capitalized universe of images and signs constitutes and de-constitutes these beings (this flesh, to borrow from Hortense Spillers, 1987) for its own purposes. As entity, non-entity, iPad, auto-part, rare-earth metal, securitized population or void, the now doubly dispossessed are materially and symbolically disappeared for politico-economic ends. In other words, not only global commodity-chain production (which relies on disappeared labor 1.0) but planetary semiosis and affect-formation (which relies on disappeared labor 2.0) are rooted in the biomass of a planet of persons excluded not just from meaningful dialogue, but from dialogue. It should be underscored that the movement from 1.0 to 2.0 is a movement that took place over a matter of centuries of racialization and gendered violence but is today ‘noticeable’ which is to say ‘theoriseable’ because the chickens are coming home to roost. As Césaire remarked, what was unforgiveable about the Holocaust, was not the brutality, torture and murder, what was unforgiveable was that the techniques of colonization were applied to white people.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Peoples of the Global South were the first ‘content providers.’ Now the situation is generalized.</p>
								<p>Understood in this way, it would appear that the result of not just history, but also of the history of representation – representation now ‘fully’ captured by capital, and shunted into an informatics matrix in which capital structures images and images structure sign function, and sign function is endemic to social production and reproduction – has been to make democracy structurally impossible. Such is the ‘reality’ for which the recession of the Real stands as symptom. The material foreclosure of the logic endemic to the conceit of human being is the technical achievement that provides the historical explanation for ‘being’ being placed under erasure in the realm of the sign. Understanding philosophically, as it were, that with the expiration of Western metaphysics one also confronts the expiration of humanism and the conceits pertaining to ‘the human’ follows logically; however understanding mediologically that this emptying out of tradition called post-structuralism is consequent upon the historico-material conversion and therefore demotion of ‘natural language’ into one medium among media requires a materialist approach to the totality of informatic networks that avowedly post-dialectical and post-historical thought cannot easily accommodate. Admittedly, it might take a book-length study to properly historicize Jacques Derrida’s <em>Of Grammatology</em> and to methodologically ‘comprehend’ the moment in intellectual history known as ‘deconstruction’ as a specific symptom of and in the long historical <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of uprooting and eviscerating language. Nonetheless, one might speculate that the ‘being’ under erasure there was formerly assumed to be part of the commons. As Kwame Anthony Appiah question indicated in ‘Is the Post- in Postmodernism the Post- in Postcolonial?’ there is an intimate connection between the erosion of the birthrights of colonized peoples and the erosion of the Western birthright purportedly guaranteed by Western metaphysics. For our purposes here we may grasp that in both the material and philosophical domains the basis and the rationale for democracy have been steadily eroded. This somewhat controversial hypothesis affirms what has been discernible at least since the onset of post- modernity: because of shifts in the matrix of representation and its material underpinnings, under advanced <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> neither reality nor being can be adequately mounted and sustained and thus neither democratic representation nor perhaps democracy is possible. From a technical perspective this is an advance. Dialectically speaking, from this historically achieved and instrumental condition of generalized simulation there is no return.</p>
								<p>Put another way, having reached historically the general fulfillment of what Marx saw clearly as the specific experience of the wage-laborer, namely &quot;the loss of reality,&quot; the real is gone and thus the aestheticization of politics is complete. It would seem that Communism must respond by politicizing simulation, which is to say, the universe of appearances mediated by abstraction, which is to say, in short, everything, however we must leave the very question of “the political” along with the transformed ontology of “politics” itself for another time.</p>

								<p><b>This article is a version of a lecture given by the author in the course Biopolitics and Aesthetics, Centre for Cultural Studies at Goldsmiths University</b></p>
								<p>During the Blair government, a new criminal offence was passed for nearly every day spent in office – this period saw the biggest expansion in the legal regulation of conduct of any time since the end of WW2. This was also a period which saw an explosion in the commissioning of public art across Britain – a commissioning frenzy, buoyed by the liquidity of the financial bubble, which has consequently been called ‘the public art bubble’. I think these phenomena can be linked, because what they represent are two prongs of a pincer form of governmentality which acts to engage and activate subjects with the one prong, while neutralizing them with the other. Or put another way, it acts to engage certain capacities, conducts and valorisable behaviors – not least the participation in aesthetic spectatorship – while at the same time disabling, discouraging and disallowing other forms of conduct deemed disruptive to the smooth functioning of the state and some of its principle activities; namely the production of a large enough, healthy, peaceable, active and economically productive population. These two phenomena – the offence bubble and the public art bubble – can also be linked as governmental strategies for managing the antagonisms and painful inequalities of neoliberal <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> as it comes to bear upon the everyday spaces of life in post-industrial urban society.</p>
								<p>We are looking at a complicated conjunction of issues – neoliberal urban development, the legal regulation of behavior, and the role of public art within the post-industrial city; each has its own specificities, developmental history and extensive body of knowledge attached. But what I want to do here is to thread them together according to certain ‘regulatory ideas’, as Foucault would say, which intersect and bind together aesthetic, governmental and economic fields. The first ones I want to think about are the concepts of ‘event’ and ‘milieu’. The act-painting of the ’40s and ’50s, and the Happenings of the ’60s swept the artwork clean first of representation, and then more broadly of ‘retinality’ as art departed pictorial and sculptural frameworks, in a bid to convene a space in which something, an ‘act’ and later an ‘event’, could occur. These twinned notions of ‘act’ and ‘event’ are deeply implicated in the multiple breaching of the art/life divide undertaken by neo-avant-garde artists of this period, and presuppose art’s ability to reach out of itself to effect some kind of wider transformation of life and the world around it, whether that be: the life of the artist or the viewer as it coincides with a set of materials, ideas or conditions during the act of creation; the way parts of the sensorium and cognitive apparatus become newly open and differently sensitised through an encounter with art – what Rancière calls the ‘redistribution of the sensible’; or art’s wider, subtle and unknowable infection of the social and physical environment, ‘indirectly, as a stored code’, as Kaprow put it.</p>
								<p>Essential to the myriad possible manifestations of the ‘event’ is the notion that it takes place in an ‘expanded field’ that entails a potentially infinite series of elements; a field which admits new contextual, environmental, social, sensual, emotional, institutional, political and material dimensions into the conception of the artwork. This expansion could be understood as a growing reflection on and recursive folding inwards of the artwork’s relationality. This folding inwards of the world, and unfurling outwards of the artwork, leads in numerous directions, from minimalism, to conceptualism to institutional critique, from body art, to performance to media art and net art, and so on. However, we need to maintain our focus on the notion of ‘event’ as a specific aspect of the artwork’s expanded field of signification in order to induce an understanding of how developments in art are reflective of those of biopolitical governmentality and, for our purposes here, within the neoliberal moment of urban development. We also need to think about how the extension and flexibilisation of the artwork makes itself newly available to deployment within a governmental and economic expansion that operates upon ever finer fissures of subjectivity.</p>
								<p>In his lecture series <em>Security, Territory, Population</em> (1977-78), Foucault discusses – in the context of the development of the modern state and its governmental rationality – the mid-17<sup>th</sup> century production of a new spatial relationship of sovereignty to its territory, one in which the capital city comes to the fore. He concentrates on a text called <em>La Métropolitée</em>, written by a French protestant émigré called Alexandre Le Maitre, for the protestant kind of Sweden. In it Le Maitre puts forwards general recommendations for the good spatial layout of a territory; one which will open up the territory to the ‘general network of the sovereign’s orders and controls’. Without getting too distracted by the detail of his schema, what Foucault seizes on is how he draws together the problems of sovereignty with a set of specifically urban problematics. He writes,</p>
								<p>In short, the interesting thing is Le Maitre dreams of connecting the political effectiveness of sovereignty to a spatial distribution. A good sovereign, be it a collective or individual sovereign, is someone well placed within a territory, and a territory that is well policed in terms of its obedience to the sovereign is a territory that has a good spatial layout.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
								<p>For Le Maitre, the capital city is the ultimate arena for the production of an ideal set of spatial conditions of sovereignty, and the exemplary life it will induce and that will act as a model for the entire territory. Foucault then tracks the changing relationship between the development of towns and cities in the context of the production of a new ‘raison d’Etat’, or state reason, which began to see the population as the state’s defining strength and, in response, developed a whole series of techniques to safeguard, nurture and monitor populations. Towns and cities, naturally, became a focal point for these developing techniques as a new rationality of the state met the demands for growth, increased production and circulation imposed by a burgeoning <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>. And here, with this new ‘securitsed’, expanded and speculative approach to city planning, is where we connect back to the notion of the event.</p>
								<p>Looking at the development of French cities such as Nantes and Vigny in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, Foucault identifies not only a response to the requirement to open up cities in order to better connect them to external routes, to deal with overcrowding and eliminate dangerous elements and so-called miasmas, but also a new consideration of possible future events that are not precisely knowable or controllable. The calculation with and management of an indefinite series of accumulating and mobile units – ‘circulation, x number of carts, x number of passers-by, x number of thieves, x number of miasmas, and so on’ – is, he says, the essential characteristic of the mechanism of security. As opposed to the ‘disciplinary’ structuring of space (here he means, the hierarchical spatial orderings of the Middle Ages) the securitized structuring of space ‘will try to plan a milieu in terms of events or series of events or possible elements, […] that will have to be regulated within a multivalent and transformable network.’<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> He ventures a further definition: ‘The space in which a series of uncertain elements unfold is, I think, roughly what one can call the milieu.’<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Borrowing the concept of ‘milieu’ from biology, and imposing it retrospectively onto the problem of city planning in this era of 17<sup>th</sup> century <em>Raison d’Etat</em>, Foucault continues,</p>
								<p>The milieu is a certain number of combined overall effects bearing on all who live in it. It is an element in which a circular link is produced between effects and causes… More disease will obviously mean more deaths. More deaths will mean more cadavers and consequently more miasmas, and so on. […] Finally, the milieu appears as a field of intervention in which, instead of affecting individuals as a set of legal subjects capable of voluntary actions […] or as a multiplicity of organisms, of bodies capable of performances – one tries to affect, precisely, a population. I mean a multiplicity of individuals who are and fundamentally and essentially only exist biologically bound to the materiality within which they live. […] What one tries to reach through this milieu, is precisely the conjunction of a series of events produced by these individuals, population, and groups and quasi natural events which occur around them.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
								<p>In this lecture series, Foucault goes on to argue and demonstrate how this urban model of sovereignty, one that he says is extended paradigmatically to the whole territory in the form of the police state, will give way to a more agriculturally focused model of governmentality in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. His argument here is subtle: the mode of state rationality developed in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, that he identifies as <em>raison d’Etat</em>, entails a logic that concedes that the state is its own manifest destiny – it no longer imagines itself as becoming an empire, or ultimately as merging with the cosmic unity and temporality of the heavens. It is held in a balance of power, after the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, with the other European states, and now turns inwards, discovering the utility of its own population which it starts to police in the interests of population expansion (which promised the freedom to pay lower wages), increased activity, greater levels of commodity production, higher levels of export and hence growing revenues to the treasury coffers.</p>
								<p>This logic changes, however, to some degree in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, with the advent of the physiocrats and the <em>économistes</em>. While <em>raison d’Etat</em> is retained in so far as the state still regards itself, its continuation, as its aim and destiny, nevertheless it is filled with a different content. This involves a refinement of its method of governmentality, from one of state intervention and control (the police state), to one of <em>laissez-faire</em>. So instead of extending the spatial model of the city to the entire territory – because it is in the city that the techniques of security and policing are developed – the idea is to ‘let nature take its course’. In regards to grain production, for example, the idea was to get rid of price controls and the control of import and export. This way production would be self-regulating, responding more agilely to the market value of grain, and ultimately better avoid the grain shortages and famines that were a frequent result of state intervention. The peasants would be better off, better fed and more productive.</p>
								<p>Without wishing to go too deeply into this historical sequence, what is important is that Foucault argues both in <em>Security, Territory, Population</em> and <em>The Birth of Biopolitics</em> that from the 18<sup>th</sup> century, an ‘art of government’ came to replace the more disciplinary and interventionist governmental reason that preceded it, and that this later art of government would retain the population as its focus – but strive to fulfill the interests of the state (higher levels of production, greater circulation and export of goods etc.) through an <em>economic</em> reason. This economic art of government is based on the notion, formulated by Adam Smith, of the ‘secret hand of the market’; a quasi-natural force that can better settle the balance of competing interests than any more rigid and partial intervention of the state.</p>
								<p>However, what is important here, and for our thinking about the links between the aesthetic blurring of art and life and biopower, is that the economic governmental reason retains the centrality of the ‘event’ and the ‘milieu’, the speculative balancing of a set of variables, which is expanded outwards from the setting of the town and its conditions, to the whole complexion of factors, interests and conditions that it needs to balance – one that would increasingly resolve into what we call ‘the economy’. Perhaps we can even go as far as to say that <em>the economy is ‘the event’ par excellence</em> of this governmental rationality. As Foucault states many times, this entails a population-scale thinking – one which departs from earlier, religious or pastoral models of sovereignty in which the entire flock must be sacrificed to save a single soul, and conversely, the single soul must be sacrificed for the salvation of the flock – an economy of souls in which every individual matters. With biopower, what we see is the state intervening only</p>
								<p>To regulate, or rather to allow the well-being, the interest of each to adjust itself in such a way that it can actually serve all. The state is envisioned as the regulator of interests and no longer as the transcendent and synthetic principle of the transformation of the happiness of each into the happiness of all.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
								<p>In this respect, the individual ceases to be important, and of interest; but the conditions affecting the mass of interactions between individuals, the ‘multiplicity of individuals’, indeed the population, becomes the site of state intervention. I want to take a bit of a leap of argumentative faith, and suggest that we can plot a related development in art from the presiding concern with the individual object – the ‘hard object’ – as it is sometimes called with reference to sculpture, to an increasingly distributed aesthetic field of attention and concern. It is interesting to consider this shift in terms of a movement from the depth model of the Christian and enlightenment subject, in which all orders of experience are of moral if not economic importance, to a flattened model of the secular and biopolitical subject in which the individual becomes a moment, or the centre of a contingent set of effects, within a mobile series of interactions. We must, of course, be careful to distinguish between the objectives of a governmental reason concerned primarily with the economic and its attendant, opportune conditions of life, and the motivating forces behind this diffusion of the artwork into a relational field. Or, put another way, the reorientation of the aesthetic field of attention from the single object often involves a critique of individuality which heads in a very different direction from the biopolitical reconception of individuality as a unit of interaction within a field of forces and effects; one of a variety of mobile units that comprise the ‘milieu’ and the ‘event’.</p>
								<p>Roland Barthes’ concept of the ‘death of the author’ and the ‘birth of the reader’ can be related to the notion of ‘singularity’ – that which defies the opposition between universal and particular, general and individual, to grasp a sense by which all universalities are particularized, given as such, but only in so far as the particular occurs this way, but could always occur otherwise; the characteristics of the particular are both being as it is, as it has occurred, but neither are they all that could potentially occur. This balance, and refusal of the general and the particular, one that allows for all the potential unrealized forms of Being in so far as it embraces Being as such, is what Agamben calls the ‘whatever singularity’. The relinquishing of the author, or the hard object, or representation, or technique, or retinality are all maneuvers through which a space is cleared, or rather a milieu is opened, grasped and excavated within which there is potential for something, the <em>whatever</em>, to occur within – call it an ‘act’, an ‘event’ or a ‘singularity’. This potential to be otherwise, or merely this <em>potential for potential</em>, is related but antithetical to Foucault’s concept of governmental securisation in which potential occurrences are speculated on and allowed for within a system or plan that must be able to accommodate, respond to, neutralize or make use of a spectrum of potential events. For the security state the event is <em>pre</em>cuperated into a social and economic equilibrium; in the best relational artworks, the event’s effects resist being put to work – they may even resist being consciously identified or understood, and operate more as a ‘stored code’, an unspent power with unknowable potential future manifestations – a whatever singularity.</p>
								<p>Returning to the problematic of the city in its neoliberal mode of development – it is important to note the transition that occurred in the 1980s from the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of ‘gentrification’ to the state-led stimulation of ‘urban regeneration’. Gentrification is a term coined by sociologist Ruth Glass in 1964 to describe the movement of affluent individuals into lower class areas of the city. The state simulation of this apparently ad hoc activity is what has been named ‘regeneration’. I want to think about how this governmental simulation, or forced stimulation of a <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> deemed natural, bears all the hallmarks of neoliberalism’s schizophrenic need to posit the naturalness of the market’s ordering of social and economic <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es on the one hand, while constantly needing to intervene to produce the correct conditions within which ‘nature’ can take its course. Here we will consider the role that <span class="importantword">creativity</span> and public art is given in the production of a set of conditions which not only apparently stimulate growth, but also affect the behavior of subjects, of city dwellers, rendering them compatible with the desired trajectory of growth, productivity, and active social participation. How, in other words, the public display of <span class="importantword">creativity</span> helps valorize life within an economic and biopoltical rationality. Part of this <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of valorization is also, of course, to pre-empt, drive out and mask over those subjects and behaviors that cannot be put to use. In this sense, we can think about how securitization extends to <span class="importantword">creativity</span> – perhaps we can call this the ‘securitization of <span class="importantword">creativity</span>’.</p>
								<p>So, as noted, initially considered an ad hoc, <em>natural</em> phenomenon, gentrification has increasingly been engineered by first local and now global networks of real estate developers and speculators in step with local governments. It should immediately be said that the outcome of gentrification is usually one of increased property prices, increased revenue to local governments from property taxes and the displacement of lower income populations. The advent of ‘urban regeneration’ in the early 1980s was largely a state-led response to the blighting of the inner city in the wake of the twin phenomena of deindustrialization and suburbanization.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> In the UK, it was also part of a governmental response to a virulent wave of riots that erupted across Britain’s streets in the summer of 1981, from London’s Brixton, Liverpool’s Toxteth, Birmingham’s Handsworth, to Leeds’ Chapeltown. During this hot summer, dispossessed populations vented their rage and contempt for a system that treated them as surplus to requirement; both neglecting and harassing them by turns. These riots – often cast as race riots – were not only a response to high unemployment (or Thatcher’s planned unemployment), biting poverty and the degenerating of housing stock, but also the aggressive policing of the non-white working class population who were subjected to discriminatory and heavy-handed policing, under ‘sus’ law – the police power to stop and search preemptively, purely on the basis of suspicion. Poet, Levi Tafari put it this way:</p>
								<p>Living inna Liverpool is living in hell look pon the places where we have fe dwell them have we under a political spell bad housing unemployment and the depression as well.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> (Tafari, L., 1989)</p>
								<p>And how did the British state respond to the uprising and discontent of significant pockets of its population? Then Secretary of the Environment, Michael Heseltine, was dispatched around the country in a helicopter, to consult with so-called community leaders. The outcome? A series of ‘Garden Festivals’ around the UK, which offer an early model of ‘cultural’ regeneration. These festivals combined the production of a series of ornamental gardens with pop-cultural hagiography – in Liverpool, for instance, the festival included a yellow submarine and a statue of John Lennon. They were typically placed in derelict industrial sites near to working class areas, and unlocked large tranches of public money to clear sites, purify land, improve transport links and eventually transfer land to private developers. At each of the Garden Festival sites, special agencies such as the Merseyside Development Corporation were established to attract private capital investment and lead regeneration in areas undergoing post-industrial decline; these QUANGOs were directly appointed by the minister and overrode local authority planning controls – a measure which would pre-empt later large-scale redevelopment projects of the ’90s and ’00s.</p>
								<p>This mode of addressing social unrest and infrastructural decline exhibits several characteristics of the biopolitical governmentality we have been discussing. The decision to clear, purify and deregulate public lands constitute a massive subsidy to the private sector which is courted and effectively underwritten to take over the state’s previous role of city development. (Soon after the festivals had ended, most of the expensively treated land they occupied was sold off to developers – an outcome that made the entire cultural experiment seem like mere foreplay). This is a prime example of the schizophrenic genuflecting to and artificial stimulation of market activity which is apparently better able to regulate social and economic activity than the state. This is also what David Harvey has termed the ‘entrepreneurial’ mode of municipal government which no longer directly addresses the material and social needs of inhabitants through the provision of services and the planning, building and maintenance of infrastructure, but which instead presents cities and city districts as attractive commodities whose inhabitants provide ‘social and cultural capital’ – effectively, just another business opportunity competing against others for inward investment from portfolio capitalists. Cultural events and signature art and architecture are of course key to this branding and selling of the city – a familiar strategy which explains much of the state subsidized public art bubble of the boom years.</p>
								<p>Another key biopolitical characteristic witnessed in the response of the Thatcher government to the misery and desperation of inner-city populations is the use of the ‘state of exception’ witnessed through the suspension of local planning laws within designated parts of the city. Actions such as these expose the state’s ultimate externality to its own laws which must, Foucault argues, be temporarily suspended in order to attain the very ends of the state, namely its perpetuation. (We should note, however, that Agamben sees the state of exception as having become sovereignty’s permanent condition of operation within <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Quoting Chemnitz, the 17<sup>th</sup> century political theorist, Foucault describes the relationship of the state to its own laws thus:</p>
								<p>In fact, raison d’Etat must command, not by ‘sticking to the laws,’ but, if necessary, it must command ‘the laws themselves, which must adapt to the present state of the republic’. So, the coup d’Etat does not break with raison d’Etat. It is an element, an event, a way of doing things that, as something that breaches the laws […] falls entirely within the general horizon, the general form of raison d’Etat.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
								<p>The coup d’Etat itself must happen almost without the population knowing, under the blanket of darkness and secrecy, presenting it with a <em>fait accompli</em>. It is interesting to consider the role of culture as part of the theatrical <em>mise-en-scene</em> that allows this micro-coup d’Etat to occur. The yellow submarine blinds us from the real, underlying economic exchanges.</p>
								<p>A further biopolitically paradigmatic aspect of the Thatcher government’s response was its attempt to intervene in the conditions of life to produce effects of ‘happiness’ and ‘well-being’ as a way of maintaining control and boosting the co-operation and productive activity of its subjects. Speaking of the development of policing in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, during the emergence of raison d’Etat, Foucault writes,</p>
								<p>So with the police there is a circle that starts from the state as a power of rational and calculated intervention on individuals and comes back to the state as a growing set of forces, or forces to be developed, passing through the life of individuals, which will now be precious to the state simply as life.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
								<p>He goes on to say that this circle will pass through more than just the life of individuals, but through their ‘convenience’, their ‘amenity’, something which amounts to ‘more than just living’ – all of which the police were charged with ensuring through their surveillance, regulation and control of the dense interactions between individuals, especially in the towns and cities. This concern for the individual’s ‘better than just living’ he writes,</p>
								<p>Must in some way be drawn on and constituted into state utility: making men’s happiness the state’s utility, making men’s happiness the very strength of the state.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
								<p>Although Foucault describes the police state as a 17<sup>th</sup> century phenomenon, something which recedes firstly within the ideology of laissez-faire, and later neoliberalism’s apparent deregulatory activity, I think it is clear that the conjunction of what we could call population optimization, short-handed as the ‘nanny state’ and its proliferating interventions into life, and the utilitarian deployment of happiness, shorthanded as the culture industry, suggest that this correlation of police work and the manufacture of happiness hasn’t disappeared but only shifted form. The roll out of an alternating sequence of either mega-sculptures (Gormley’s <em>Angel of the North</em>, Wallinger’s proposed <em>White Horse</em> at Ebbsfleet, and Kapoor’s <em>ArcelorMittal Orbit</em> tower for the Olympic site), or relational and ephemeral urban interventions, reveals something of the uneasy marriage of agendas that conspire around public art to help deliver the effects of happiness the state so badly needs to gain the acquiescence and self-regulation of subjects within the context of large-scale urban change.</p>
								<p>It is precisely this conjunction of happiness and control that philosopher Maria Muhle wants to emphasize through her rejection of those characterizations of biopower that cast it as an aggressive take-over of life. Instead, she argues, it is a modality that possesses a positive and not merely repressive relation to life. ‘My claim’, she writes, ‘is that biopolitics is defined by the fact that rather than merely relating to life, it takes on the way life itself functions; that it functions like life in order to be better able to regulate it.’<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> So there are positive and pleasurable aspects to the governmental subsumption of life – its life-like activity – that relate to art’s desire to be more like-life and less like the moribund objects within the museum. Indeed, the production of this ‘positive’ relation, often entails the deployment of art for governmental and economic ends – as has been amply demonstrated by the paradigm of the Creative City. The general aestheticisation of urban spaces certainly helps mark off the disciplinary city of factory work from the securitized city of immaterial production and consumption. The pain, filth and graft of production is increasingly purged from our cities (or at least from view), and with it the workers who performed this graft. In its place comes the illusion of our general conversion to a pleasurable, weightless form of production, and the accompanying figure of what in German is called the ‘Bummler’, the ambler, the Bourgeois enjoyer of the city as a playground rich in cultural and retail diversions. No longer the austere streets of factory towns, but the slick and virtualized pedestrian zones of creative quarters, in which people’s happiness is catered to, life is deemed ‘more than just lived’, and art contributes invaluably to a cultivation and passification of public space. But it is not just the use of art for the production of happiness effects and place branding, I would argue, that creates discomfort for the more conscious practitioners, but the sharing of certain characteristics by aesthetic and governmental regimes. Beyond a shared orientation towards the event and the milieu – complex fields of interrelation between life, activity and environment which entail a speculative approach to potential effects – there are other key ‘regulatory ideas’ operative in both realms, namely the concepts of ‘engagement’ and ‘openness’.</p>
								<p>In a recent interview about making art in the context of regeneration with the artist Alberto Duman, we discussed how the ‘hard object’ had been relegated in public art practice over the last decade or so.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> He drew attention to how the sculptural tradition in public art has given way to ‘a situation where everything but the object is the way to do public art’, the normativity of which he finds disturbing. According to art historian Miwon Kwon, in her book <em>One Place After Another</em>, this normative switchover came with the critical reception of the public art exhibition Culture in Action, curated by Jane Jacob, in Chicago in 1993. It is worth quoting the curator’s assessment of the trajectory from the site-specific object to the community-oriented public artwork to be reminded of how this development was unequivocally linked to progressive social effects, and actively delinked from the development agendas we now see harnessing it. She writes,</p>
								<p>As public art shifted away from large-scale objects, to physically or conceptually site specific projects, to audience specific concerns (work made in response to those who occupy a given site), it moved from an aesthetic function, to a design function, to a social function. Rather than serving to promote the economic development of American cities, as did public art beginning in the late 1960s, it is now being viewed as a means of stabilizing community development through urban centers. In the 1990s the role of public art has shifted from that of renewing the physical environment to that of improving society, from promoting aesthetic quality to contributing to the quality of life, from enriching lives to saving lives.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
								<p>What is interesting here is not only how she counters socially-oriented public art to economic development, but also how governmental her language sounds when she sites the objectives of this kind of work: ‘stabilizing community development’ and ‘improving society’ and ‘improving the quality of life’, not to mention the extraordinary grandiosity of her claim that art can save lives. Running through this equation of art’s social orientation with ameliorating social effects is the implicit idea that the art can serve to activate members of the ‘community,’ to ‘engage’ them in constructive dialogues, to alter their behavior. This conception of activated spectatorship, and its coupling to the blurring of art and life, presents a crucial isomorphism between aesthetics and the self-management of the subject that biopolitical info-<span class="importantword">capitalism</span> attempts to stage. Present here is also a kind of crass identification between notions of engaged spectatorship and a literalisation of activity that attempts to draw out aesthetic contemplation into immediate behavioral and social effects. In his book <em>The Emancipated Spectator</em>, Rancière exposes what he considers the cul-de-sac of avant-garde notions of activating the audience, from Brecht to Debord, for the imposition, finally, of a prescriptive and ‘sovereign’ notion of what counts as activity onto an audience contemptuously imagined as unrelentingly passive, as victims of the spectacle. Speaking of the wish to abolish the separation of active performers from passive spectators, or between the spaces of art and everyday life, in avant-garde theatre he says,</p>
								<p>But the redistribution of places is one thing; the requirement that theatre assign itself the goal of assembling a community which ends the separation of the spectacle is quite another. The first involves the invention of new intellectual adventures, the second a new form of allocating bodies to their rightful place, which, in the event, is their place of communion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
								<p>Rejecting the self-imposed necessity of theatre to literalize the ‘community’ of spectators occupying the theatre at any one time, Rancière argues that, to the contrary,</p>
								<p>In a theatre, in front of a performance, just as in a museum, school or street, there are only ever individuals plotting their own paths in the forest of things, acts and signs that confront or surround them.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
								<p>Art, he is arguing need not and should not strive to create a collectivity of its spectators. Art that attempts this fails to recognize the capacity that has always already joined people across boundaries, namely, the ‘shared power of the equality of intelligence’ which ‘makes them exchange their intellectual adventures, in so far as it keeps them separate from one another, equally capable of using the power everyone has to plot her own path.’<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> It is easy to see the potential overlaps between the community creating desires of avant-gardism which neglect the singularity of the viewer’s experience and thought, and the desire of the New Labour government to create a stakeholder society, a series of communities in which a place and activity is allocated to each and every one, but which takes no soul into account.</p>
								<p>I think Anthony Gormley’s public art exemplifies the stakes of this institutional take-over of engagement and participation – we see its machinations whirring around most nakedly in his 2009 work for Trafalgar Square’s fourth column titled, <em>One and Other</em>. This piece entailed the rotation of a volunteer living occupant of the plinth on an hourly basis; an occupation which was filmed and archived on its associated website. In a grotesque bureaucratic aping of avant-garde notions of the audience’s co-production of the work, the volunteer needed to obtain the right to participate by applying, via a website, and having their intended action vetted in advance before being given a time slot. The performances, by and large, became a theatre of civil society initiatives, exaggerated presentations of identity and narcissistic exhibitionism. This work, it seems to me, operates according to the Agambanian logic of ‘inclusive exclusion’, a logic that uses the very act of inclusion as a means to exclude subjects from the scene of the political or the aesthetic. The artwork becomes a microcosm of the inclusive exclusion of the democratic <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> itself; participants, like voters, are fairly and evenly, if impersonally and bureaucratically treated, given a voice within the narrowly constructed terms of a permissible utterance and, in so doing, denied the ability to be heard, act collectively or engage in any ‘act’ that might rupture the normal functioning of things. They are effectively engaged in order to be neutralized, in the interests of the self-perpetuation of the state or the state-like power of Gormley’s signature branding of high-profile public space.</p>
								<p>This stake of institutionalized engagement – its logic of inclusive exclusion – is often discussed by artists who have worked within the context of regeneration as a tactic of ‘soft policing’ performed on those populations who will be most dramatically affected by development. Alberto Duman has described the consultative work of public artists in regeneration or ‘social conflict zones’ as that of appeasement. He says, ‘The artist, very often is called in with a fairly backward idea that art has the capacity to negotiate, be a meeting place, art is a space where differences are negotiated because it can transcend the specifics of the situation, of time and space.’<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> And yet, he is keen to point out, this negotiating capacity of art is wielded from one side, namely by those who are driving the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of regeneration. As with the Big Society, public engagement is solicited just at the moment when the conditions which nurture and sustain community are being dismantled, through the generalized enclosures and sell-offs of public assets, the privatization and shrinkage of public services and the ‘social cleansing’ of non-productive life from the inner city. Far from ‘saving lives’, socially-oriented artworks such as Gormley’s often provide the image of what Boris Groys has called the regime of ‘aesthetic equal rights’ as a cover for the reduction of the working class population’s rights of access to the means of subsistence.</p>
								<p>With a sharp sense of this double-sided, or as he calls it ‘two-faced’, character of much participatory public art, Duman submitted a highly sarcastic proposal to the Spitalfields Sculpture Prize in 2009. The sculpture was intended to be sited in the conflict zone of a relatively new corporate plaza that had been laid over the now demolished site of one half of Spitalfields Market in East London. The prize is funded by Hammerson, the developers behind the commercial development of the area over the last 15 years. Playing a ‘two-faced’ game himself, Duman submitted plans for a giant, 10m high ‘Cleaning in Progress’ sign that would be both eye-catching, amusing and provide shelter for shoppers and amblers from the elements. Of course the sting in the tail of this apparently innocuous object was that the cleaning it makes reference to is both social and literal; it commemorates those who have been purged from the area in order to make way for the high real estate and rental values it can now command, and flags up the relegation of those working class occupants who remain to the ancillary role of cleaners and service workers; the ghosts who maintain the space but for whom it isn’t intended. The giant sign acts in solidarity with these ghosts who haunt and preserve the spaces of pleasure and consumption, whilst allowing the new occupants to shelter under its protective mantle.</p>
								<p>For Boris Groys, avant-garde art’s development of a regime of ‘equal aesthetic rights’ hinges on the idea, linked to the blurring of art and life, that the classical avant-garde ‘has struggled to achieve recognition of all signs, forms, and things as legitimate objects of artistic desire and, hence, also as legitimate objects of representation in art.’<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> He sees a parallel between the aesthetic struggle for recognition, and the political struggle for the recognition and inclusion of all minorities. Within art, however, the thought that anything can potentially be recognized as art potentially leads to an entropic game where each artwork appears to be simply an arbitrary and unnecessary extension or iteration of this field of equal rights. However, he argues, art today ‘operates in the gap between the formal equality of all art forms and their factual inequality.’<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> So, while recognizing the potential legitimacy of anything as art, in reality not everything is considered as such and admitted into the museum or the canon. ‘The good artwork’, he continues, ‘is precisely that work which affirms the formal equality of all images under the conditions of their factual inequality. This gesture is always contextual and historically specific, but it also has paradigmatic importance as a model for further repetition of the gesture.’<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> I think Duman’s work strikes just such a balance, elevating the readymade plastic sign to a higher power which implies the potential elevation of any profane object, whilst mobilizing this banal object to signify the factual exclusion of former inhabitants who become the ‘revenants’ of this apparent space of open, democratic enjoyment. Put another way, the participation of the banal object in the aesthetic regime of equal rights becomes a cipher for the factual impossibility of participation within a wider regime of participatory aesthetics.</p>
								<p>Earlier I mentioned that ‘openness’ was another regulatory idea that intersects governmental, economic and aesthetic terrains. As with the regime of equal aesthetic rights, the principle of openness can also happily co-exist with and co-produce factual inequalities and closed or proprietary systems. We see this everywhere from the deployment of the open standards of the web, such as HTML and HTTP to run proprietary software or for private profit, to the double standards of free market <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> where developing countries are compelled to open up their markets and allow inward investment while economic giants like the US are able to maintain trade barriers and subsidies for domestic production. Openness itself is a kind of conceptual medium along which, as chairman for the US Business Committee for the Arts in the 80s Winton Blount once said, business can also travel. Fighting trade regulations, taxation and overt government control was not just a civic duty, he argued, but a means of keeping ‘open those avenues of freedom along which art and commerce both travel.’<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
								<p>Roman Vasseur, Lead Artist appointed to oversee the redevelopment of Harlow New Town, has argued, this reversibility of openness can also extend to who might be considered an artist in the context of creative-led regeneration. ‘One can envisage a future’ he says, ‘where artists, or individuals with an extensive training in the visual arts and art history will be slowly moved out of this new economy in favor of “creatives” able to privilege deliverability and consultation over other concerns.’<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> It is worth considering how the energies that drive the privileging of openness as an aesthetic, technical, economic and social form waver between the political horizon of inclusion and the degraded, flattening equivalence of the value form. This has the interesting effect of driving the Beuysian claim that ‘everyone is an artist’ in at least two directions at once: the death of the author also presides over the birth of the professionalized creative. What this final example reveals is the extent to which governmental and economic calculation and the social engineering of happiness can move along similar trajectories as the life-oriented activities of art. But in keeping with Groys’ remarks about the good artwork, the artistic attempt to promote a life which is ‘more than just lived’ cannot take place under the monocultural regime of human capital, or under the logic of biopolitical happiness, if it does not draw attention to the way biopolitical <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> mobilizes individuals to create optimum effects within its own paradigm of population optimization. The good artwork that aims to act upon life takes into account the more radical horizons of openness, event, act, milieu, engagement and participation, admitting as much to the factual absence of these realities as to the potential for their potential in a wholly unspecified future form.</p>

<span class="author">Marc James Léger</span><span class="words"> | 2.105 words | <a href="#"><span class="importantword">creativity</span></a>, <a href="#">Capital</a>, <a href="#">Abstraction</a></span>								<p>How can we explain the grey zone, the minimum distance between <span class="importantword">creativity</span> and capitalist demand? How can we understand creative autonomy and resistance in the context of renewed expectations for art to have a direct social and political utility? What can psychoanalysis contribute to art criticism as it relates to the field of politicized visual art, now more commonly referred to as socially engaged art? What does the notion of the avant garde mean for cultural production in a world of networked connectivity, participatory ideology and creative industry dispossession? According to Slavoj Žižek, when art production is increasingly subjected to commodification, and when commodities are increasingly aestheticized, artworks are no longer able to sustain the lack in the big Other, understood here as the agency of belief in art’s social and cultural significance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> One symptom of this phenomenon is the view that art today has collapsed directly into political economy. In the words of the editors of <em>e-flux</em> journal, “contemporary art <em>is</em> neoliberalism in its most purified form”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> The truth of this assertion is that artworks are particularly apt as signifiers of castration. As <span class="importantword">creativity</span> marks ever more aspects of daily life, almost any kind of work not only can, but in a kind of frenetic hysteria, must be elevated to the place of Art.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> While this may seem a standard postmodern argument for the breakdown of the distinction between high art and mass culture, postmodernism tends nevertheless to leave belief in the aesthetic intact, proliferating through the fields of discourse it comes into contact with. In the following, I argue against postmodern relativism, however, and wish to consider instead, to paraphrase Žižek in his thinking on Christianity, “the perverse core” of avant-garde art production.</p>
								<h3 id="art-for-imbeciles">Art for Imbeciles</h3>
								<p>In an essay on what he calls “enclave theory,” John Roberts made the somewhat startling assertion that many of the most progressive art theories of recent years, those attributed to Nicolas Bourriaud, Gregory Sholette, Grant Kester, Stephen Wright, and even theorists like Jean-Luc Nancy, Alain Badiou, Slavoj Žižek, Bruno Bosteels, Felix Guattari, Toni Negri and Michael Hardt, represent the “invariant core of a communist programme” that is “largely divorced from the past,” in particular, from its Stalinist Communist party organizations, and is committed rather to “culturally aestheticized” “autonomous forms of productive, intellectual and creative community”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> What is surprising in this claim is the idea that these are invariant forms, and not significantly different. Roberts asks us to consider what all of these theorists’ perspectives on radical culture have in common rather than what distinguishes them. This gesture might not be such a bad way to understand the so-called “crisis” of art and art criticism in a world of cultural corporatization and neoliberal engineering of creative capital. Whatever contemporary art’s failings in terms of pursuing revolutionary class struggle, it represents, according to Roberts, a kind of leftist bloc against what Gregory Sholette terms enterprise culture. Perhaps one of the most acerbic depictions of the art world as a rigged system of economic and social exploitation is Bruce Barber’s 2008 drawing titled <em>Artworld Ponzi Scheme</em>, which shows a pyramid comprised of payers, prayers and players, all of them trapped within a hierarchically inegalitarian system. The intrigue in this drawing, especially as it comes after the biggest financial debacle since the 1970s, is that the currency of art is premised on false claims, or even “toxic assets.”</p>

								<p>The idea that art has no socially agreed upon justifications has been addressed by anthropologist David Graeber, who wonders why contemporary theorists attending an art symposium at the Tate Museum should explain the 2008 fiasco by taking recourse to avant-garde art created between 1916 and 1922.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> His point is that we are potentially once again living a revolutionary moment, but that epistemological subversion through culture and post-structuralist theory seems to satisfy only liberal academics. The return to avant-gardism, he argues, effects “a subtle form of conservatism – or, perhaps one should say conservative radicalism, if such were possible – a nostalgia for the days when it was possible to put on a tin-foil suit, shout nonsense verse, and watch staid bourgeois audiences turn into outraged lynch mobs.” These days are gone, he argues, replaced by the immaterial labor and service economy analysis of people like Maurizio Lazzarato and Toni Negri. The art of the rich, he goes on, has more to do with the analysis of products than of social <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es, floating above the mire of ordinary existence. Art today appears to contemporary political philosophers to belong to the immaterial domain, a fact that exacerbates its condition of crisis. The art world, for Graeber, is the apparatus of people who manage this crisis. Unable to define the category of art in any way that is adequate beyond its quality as something that only rich people and museums can afford to buy, the art world cannot establish its own legitimacy. Graeber then argues that the essence of politics in social life is to make people believe. Things become true if you can convince enough people to believe them. In order to play the game effectively, one must not oneself know the essence of things. He concludes from this that if the art world was to recognize itself as a form of politics, it would also need to “recognize itself as something both magical, and a confidence game – a kind of scam”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Insofar as the art world has become an appendage to financial capital, fictive capital explains fictive cultural value as well. All the players, he argues, cynics and idealists alike, draw on outmoded nineteenth-century notions of art, even those who create “enclaves” where they can experiment with new forms of life.</p>
								<p>Where Graeber gets at the issue is when he later argues that for all of the fictionalization that takes place across the social field, the magically created value of art is no less real. This assertion confirms the Lacanian emphasis on the reality of illusion, which contrasts to transgressions that merely try to escape the Real. In this regard, Žižek agrees with Badiou, who argues that art is a medium of truth. This also relates to the Marxist understanding of commodity fetishism, which states that even if capitalists understand that workers produce the value of their merchandise, they nevertheless continue to believe in the miracle of exchange. The famous Žižekian example, of course, is the anecdote about Niels Bohr, who when asked if he believed in the good luck derived from a horse shoe, replied he did not, but that apparently it works even if one does not believe in it. Rather than payer, player and prayer, then, categories that Barber leaves undefined, I would like to propose the set of three subject positions that Žižek outlines at the start of <em>Less Than Nothing</em>: the idiot, the moron and the imbecile.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> All three positions are premised on the Lacanian theory of the big Other, which stands for the heterogeneous social rules that together comprise what Lacan defines as the social symbolic. As an impersonal social agency, the big Other stands in for those rules that shape the unconscious of the social subject.</p>
								<p>The first of the three is the idiot, defined by Žižek as someone who is “too intelligent to <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> implicit social rules”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The idiot imagines himself beyond the influence of the big Other and knows the rules (of art) all too well to be able to <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> them in a way beyond his hyper-intellectuality. As the first of two examples of idiots within contemporary art theory, both colleagues of mine, we have Gregory Sholette and his concept of “dark matter.” According to Sholette, dark matter describes the “shadowy social productivity” that haunts the high art world. The great many excluded practices and failed artists who keep the world of galleries, collections, and magazines going, Sholette argues, are today threatening this pyramidal system as their dark energy becomes increasingly visible. The book <em>Dark Matter</em> thus presents itself as a “lumpenography” of this invisible mass of makeshift, amateur, informal, unofficial, autonomous, activist, non-institutional, and self-organized practices.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Sholette argues that art critics, art historians, arts administrators, collectors and dealers typically have little interest in creative dark matter. There is no question that the art world is made up not only of what is known about art, but involves a complex division of labor and specialized tasks that work to keep a multi-billion-dollar industry operating for the benefit of a minority of high profile artists. This system keeps the vast majority of professionally trained artists in a state of subservience and underdevelopment. The first and most general question that is asked by Sholette is what would happen if this superfluous majority went on permanent strike and gave up on the art system’s means of legitimation. Contemporary high art is thoroughly connected, he says, to Art Inc. and does not hide its profit motivations. It is only those dark practices at the margins that still hold on to this former (avant-garde) task of art to challenge commercial goals. While Sholette does appreciate the labor theory of value, he suspends the understanding that most forms of culture are non-productive and rather dependent in complex ways on profits collected elsewhere in the proletarianized global marketplace. Bourdieu’s sociology of art, in contrast, benefited from its use of the concept of social totality. The absence of the use of the concept of totality in Sholette’s book prevents him from offering a class analysis of culture that would go beyond redistributive justice. Also, dark matter seems to share very little common ground with the avant-garde tradition of revolutionary art, whose distinct purpose is to represent the social function of art in class society. As Žižek has argued, an ideological identification exerts the greatest pressure on us when we fool ourselves into believing we are not fully identical to it. The epistemological crisis in the arts that is mentioned in Sholette’s introduction to <em>Dark Matter</em> should therefore not be thought to directly reflect the crisis in global capital, though the connections between these spheres do indeed need to be drawn.</p>
								<p>A second idiot in this set is Brian Holmes and his theory of “liar’s poker.” Holmes is one of the sharpest analysts of artistic resistance within societies of control and is also, like so many contemporary theorists, skeptical of avant-garde modes of contestation. Within the new flexible regimes of accumulation and casual freelance culture, the demands for autonomy, he argues, are diverted into new modes of control.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The premise of liar’s poker, as he puts it, is that “when people talk about politics in an artistic frame, they’re lying”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Cultural institutions, he argues, constantly demand that artists “picture politics,” playing the art game and representing those who are excluded to those who are safely nestled inside, especially transnational corporations, who then support the realm of art as a sphere that is separate from abstract financial decisions. Anti-art artists who work directly in the public sphere or on the terrain of everyday life, or within new technological and scientific landscapes, only pretend to leave behind the artistic frame. In reality they collude with curators and directors to show images of political reality. Because the latter are averse to such realism, the artist has to bluff their way through. Holmes assumes, however, that an artist involved with a social movement is an artist that has successfully challenged the guilt relations of the art system. Because of this he is deeply suspicious of the function of belief, which, he argues, is a powerful or interesting fetish, an illusion that gets players caught in the game rather than directly confronting power, as in the case of artworks that deepen the links between art activism and social movements. What distinguishes Holmes from Žižek, however, is that he does not ask us to believe even more in art and to directly assume the lack in the big Other – a small distinction, but a crucial one if we are to see art institutions as anything more than duplicitous. Like Sholette, Holmes is concerned that institutions seek cultural capital among “the more radical fractions of the artistic field”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The artist has to produce the ace of politics, he argues, while proving all the while that the ace is merely a joker, thereby undermining the reality of the illusion. Like so many leftists, Holmes assumes that the big Other is or can be occupied.</p>
								<p>The second subject position outlined by Žižek is the moron, defined by “the stupidity of those who fully identify with common sense, who fully stand for the big Other of appearances”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Two notable cultural theorists who might in some ways fill this description are Grant Kester and Claire Bishop. Kester is a seasoned art critic with a long track record of insightful writing on the shift from public art and identity politics in the 1980s and 90s to the new phenomenon of community art in the 90s and 2000s. The type of site-specific collaborative work that he champions unfolds, he says, through an extended interaction with local communities. Like many proponents of the new tendencies, he has worked to anchor his theory of “dialogical aesthetics” in both social and political history as well as the philosophy of aesthetics. While erudite and knowledgeable, Kester’s polemic, as presented in his book <em>The One and the Many</em>, is intensely prescriptive.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> For the sake of artist groups like Park Fiction, Ala Plastica, and Dialogue, all avant-garde tactics (reduced to formalist modernism) are proscribed, including the work of leading cultural theorists like Barthes, Derrida, de Certeau, Lyotard, Kristeva, Blanchot, Badiou, Deleuze and Guattari, Agamben, Nancy, Levinas, and Rancière – anyone associated with the post-May 68 generation of postmodern pessimism and who programmatically guard against premature totalizations. “We are witnessing today,” he writes, “a certain disenchantment with the existing parameters of avant-garde art and an attempt to rearticulate the specificity of the aesthetic in relationship to both the viewer and to other cultural and political practices”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The leitmotif of avant-garde and theoretical post-structuralism, he argues, is the impossibility of social cohesion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> In contrast, Kester is interested in the global phenomenon and success of collaborative modes of production, as found for instance in the work of Border Arts Workshop, Group Material, REPOhistory, Gran Fury, Platform, WochenKlausur, and Groupo Etcetera, where emphasis is placed on multiple authorship, participatory relation to audience, and <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>-based activist intervention.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Despite his critique of what he calls the “intellectual baroque,” Kester’s dialogical aesthetics retains many of the typical leitmotifs of postmodernism, especially the distinctions that are made between pluralism and an older avant-garde notion of culture that retained some links to the class politics of socialism. With globalization, I would argue, social forms have channeled culture in such a way as to give it a privileged role in economic development. According to George Yúdice, culture is today treated as an expedient, construed as a resource for sociopolitical ameliorism and job creation, a <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> that coincides with capitalist ideology and biopolitical regulation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> The role of culture, Yúdice argues, “has expanded in an unprecedented way into the political and economic at the same time that conventional notions of culture have been emptied out”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Unlike Sholette and Holmes, Kester tends to underplay this problem of institutional mediation, leaving actually existing institutions all the more operative in the administration of socially engaged art.</p>
								<p>Another critic we could add to the group of morons is Claire Bishop. Bishop is well-known for her 2004 <em>October</em> essay in which she criticized Bourriaud’s relational aesthetics for its rhetoric of democracy and emancipation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The open works advocated by contemporary critics like Bourriaud foreground interaction rather than contemplation and engagement rather than passivity and disengagement, assuming that these former modalities are inherently political and emancipatory. She argues that Bourriaud wants to equate aesthetic judgement with political judgement. “But how,” she asks, “do we measure or compare these relationships?”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Dialogue, she says, is assumed in advance to be democratic, excluding other modalities, like autonomy, antagonism, oppositionality, destabilization, and artworks that recognize the limits of “society’s ability to fully constitute itself”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> She defines the autonomy of the artwork in terms of the social antagonism that is mirrored in the tension between art and society. Bishop insists that we should be better able to judge art itself and not merely better politics, and therefore acknowledge the limits of what art can do. One of the problems here is the return to the function of criticism and the assumption that art, by itself, can be the object of objective assessment. In this gesture Bishop obviates the notion of antagonism that she otherwise recognizes. While she exposes what is repressed in the idea of social harmony, she ignores how art itself acts as this agent of repression. In this regard, <em>Artificial Hells</em>, her latest treatment of participatory art, mostly expands the number of examples rather than improve the initial theory.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn83" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> She worries about the instrumentalization of participatory art, something Kester is less troubled by, but perhaps misses the point that this apprehension is misplaced insofar as it concerns itself with art <em>per se</em> and art criticism as a means of institutional legitimation (perhaps to satisfy critics like Graeber). She very correctly recognizes that the new European cultural policies enacted under <em>New Labour</em> in the U.K. are a form of social engineering but fails to produce a theory that addresses how and why art eludes such institutionalization.</p>
								<p>I would argue, in contrast, that it is quite possible for an artwork to be valid as an autonomous and critical work and at the same time to defy institutional capture, and this, without denying the incompleteness of the social. For me to say this, I should think that I belong to the third group in Žižek’s series: the imbeciles. An imbecile is someone whose mental retardation causes him to be aware of the need for a big Other, but who does not rely on it. The imbecile is somewhere between the idiot and the moron, who recognizes the function of language but who distrusts it.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The big Other exists, but is inconsistent. The question for aesthetics, then, is to consider in theoretical and not only sociological terms the ways in which the art world guarantees the consistency of the rules of art, allowing for dark matter to be distinguished from consecrated artists. What unites the idiot, the moron and the imbecile is the inconsistency of their belief in the big Other of art and, as I argue further on, this inconsistency represents the “perverse core” of aesthetics as such.</p>
								<h3 id="the-reality-of-the-fiction">The Reality of the Fiction</h3>
								<p>What is the significance of critical art in the context of contemporary cultural theory, within the space of culture in general, and as it is being reengineered to conform ever more tightly with the needs of accumulation – leading many to presume that avant-garde artworks and films have been made obsolete by new social relations and by the new regimes of production? Here I would like to pursue the path of the imbecile with reference to Žižek’s chapter on Christianity in the opening “Drink Before” section of <em>Less Than Nothing</em>. The trick is to not reduce theory to empiricism and to focus on the negative energy of art rather than the positivity of the social causes that artists are being increasingly expected to deal with directly. While I do not agree with those who argue that art and reparative social work or political propaganda are inherently separate activities, I do think that socially engaged art benefits from some aesthetic theorizing that goes beyond German idealism.</p>
								<p>Žižek’s attention to Hegel in <em>Less Than Nothing</em> is largely due to the overlap with Lacan and Žižek’s view that among the German idealists, Hegel alone is able to sustain the idea of the lack in the big Other and the dialectical reversal that occurs when an epistemological obstacle is transposed directly into the Thing itself – here the work of art.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> “Our inability to know the thing indicates a crack in the thing itself, so that our very failure to reach the full truth is the indicator of truth”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> No wonder then that dark matter, to take up the metaphor, is obviated by the obsession with the celebrity star system: Picasso, Van Gogh, Ai Weiwei, Gerhard Richter, Jeff Koons, what have you. One problem in the structure of ideology, Žižek explains, is that there is no public, no symbolic agency that is there to register or witness the disasters of <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>. What is missing is the big Other, the space of symbolic inscription and ideological suture. In contrast to Claire Bishop’s quest to determine institutional criteria for judging participatory art, Žižek writes:</p>
								<p>Schoenberg still hoped that somewhere there would be at least one listener who would truly understand his atonal music. It was only his greatest pupil, Anton Webern, who accepted the fact that there is no listener, no big Other to receive the work and properly recognize its value.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
								<p>There are no guarantees for art and this becomes one of the principal axioms of the notion of <span class="importantword">creativity</span>. Those who worry that all <span class="importantword">creativity</span> is today harnessed by capital miss an important point: the form of illusory appearance remains on the surface of things and is thus closer to the Real than historical reality itself. The concern of political moralists and reformists is often to escape from the Real of illusion through some kind of transgression that seeks to show the true, so-called “phenomenal” reality, usually by pointing to some token of reality: bodily affect, group interaction, S&amp;P indicators, the haptic qualities of new media, etc. The idea that art criticism should be more global in scope, representing a greater diversity of experiences, is one way among many to avoid the Real of illusion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn88" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> What then can artworks tell us about the changing parameters of what Peter Bürger defined as the “institution art”?<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn89" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
								<p>The unique quality of art is that more than most other things in our social universe it can express the reality of illusion through any random object. This illusory quality is a secret, in Marx the commodity fetish, or in Lacan, the ineffable <em>objet a</em> that allows anything to be elevated to the concept of Art and allows it to be installed in the symbolic order. The artist comes closest to this understanding when he or she intervenes through the neutral position of the analyst.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> The artist’s neutrality cannot be socially localized since the art thing has no ontological reality but is a virtual point. This is what Lacan refers to in the notion of <em>le père ou le pire</em> – the oedipal father or the worse, the choice of art as the worse option, which more effectively undermines the entire symbolic field. Avant-garde works represent a negative force against the organic unity of community and as such are vital to emancipatory politics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn91" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Strict egalitarian emancipation cancels rather than preserves the organic unity of the hierarchical social order. Radical art operates as the obscene disavowed underside of the art world ponzi scheme. How so?</p>
								<p>Almost every artwork preserves some aspect of the idea of art as a reserve, or background against which we can measure deviations. Art’s non-art status is therefore inscribed into the idea of Art – something that Duchamp was perhaps the first artist to expound. Art is deeply atheistic, to put things in terms of belief, and perversion is at the core of the aesthetic. The obsession with the ineffable big Other is sublated into acts of creation, something that Lacan defines as drive. <span class="importantword">creativity</span> can therefore be defined as the eruption of a new form that reorganizes the social field, imposing itself as a new necessity through an act of ungrounded subjective decision, abandoned by Art and with no guarantee of aesthetic value or art world consecration.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn92" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> The inscrutability of the aesthetic big Other, even as blue chip investment, is the certitude of <span class="importantword">creativity</span>, the condition of its ecstatic production. Since art is dead and the author is dead and since therefore the function of the critic is nullified, art making and art judgments are sacrificed to a pure Otherness of subjective destitution.</p>
								<p>Art making is a scandal that undermines art from within. Such work has a tragic self-effacing quality that socially engaged art sometimes refuses in its resentment and narcissistic hatred of the “no” of Art. It denounces art in favor of ethics but it does so through the disavowal of the love of art. It proffers the socially networked artist as the better of the avant-garde artist but it is the latter who properly betrays the extorsion of <span class="importantword">creativity</span>. The revolutionary artist acts unconditionally and therefore comes closest to art’s expression of freedom and emancipation, insisting, much like Antigone, on symbolic demand. The creative artist is consequently excluded from the community of humans.</p>
								<p>Holmes’ notion of “liar’s poker” can be explained as the insistence on aesthetic sublimation rather than the insistence on the refusal of co-optation; it implies an awareness of the monstrosity of the game since the game is not only fixed in the symbolic order, but more radically, since through his or her act the artist believes in the game more than s/he is aware. The artist acts as though he or she is not aware of capitalist recuperation, observing the appearances, the virtuality of the illusion of the real. In the case of Barber’s pyramid, the ‘prayer’ in the set represents a transitive function; he or she does not have to believe since belief is presupposed by the artwork as virtual entity. No wonder then that so many artists today are attempting to go beyond the making of objects, taking social interaction itself as the direct instantiation of art. This becomes possible due to the perverse core of art and is an indication of the transitivity of belief. The paradox, however, is that if we take away whatever stands in for belief, we lose the reality of the illusion and so any claim to emancipation through the community of believers is equally annulled. The function of the art world, therefore – critics, museums, magazines, even this essay – is to maintain appearances, in particular, against any agency or Master who would pretend to know everything. The master artist is the person who possesses an almost God-like ability to both make art and to simultaneously prohibit the making of art. This prohibition takes the form in capitalist society of symbolic castration through surplus value. A provisional definition of the avant-garde artist can therefore be the condition of the acceptance of the inexistence of aesthetic criteria. There are no guarantees for the social importance of artworks, only the passage from <span class="importantword">creativity</span> to consequences. For things to happen, creation must be a condition of the truth of illusion.</p>

<span class="author">Ana Vilenica</span><span class="words"> | 2.105 words | <a href="#"><span class="importantword">creativity</span></a>, <a href="#">Capital</a>, <a href="#">Abstraction</a></span>								<p><b>This text was written within the framework of the project “Creative Work and Urban Regenerations”, financed by the Secretariat for Science and Technological Development of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, as part of a campaign entitled “The Right to a First Chance”. One version of this text was published in a collection of papers of the Institute for Researching Art in Novi Sad: Vilenica, Ana, “Umetnost regeneracije grada – Predu(z)metništvo kao biznis model novih geopolitičkih konstelacija [The Art of City Regeneration – Artepreneurship as a Business Model of New Geopolitical Constellations]”.</b></p>
								<p>The capitalization of cultural resources has become a central issue of post-industrial urban rule, and in capitalist societies art and culture has become an important instrument in the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of creating new spatial and geopolitical constellations. Creative armies of designers and artists are employed as a resource for cosmetic renovations of cities, production of simulacra of authenticity and symbolic capital in the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of creating a new class geography of the city. In the context of Serbia, such a structural connection between culture, art and capital is practiced within the framework of the project of <em>cultivating</em> the capitalist periphery through the practices of culture-guided urban regenerations wherein the art establishment, cultural and creative industries and social-entrepreneurial art take part. In the local context, culture-guided urban regenerations are most often presented uncritically, as an always positive contribution of the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of city <em>development</em>, the shaping of its <em>identity</em>, its <em>modernization</em> and <em>progress</em>, both in public narratives and in the academic discourse. Such a discursive practice acts as an accomplice to the attempts at smoothly carrying out aggressive <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of transformation in cities that merely continue to produce the unendurable state of enormous social disparities, the degradation of workers’ and social rights and the environment, as well as the all-round discrimination of all those who do not belong to the desirable higher classes, ethnicity, race or sexual orientation. Understanding this state of affairs, as well as the role of culture and art, in a situation of constant production of manipulative images and false promises, turns out to be an important perspective towards articulating possible future forms of struggle and creation of &quot;new territories&quot;.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn93" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
								<h3 id="urban-regenerations-and-the-role-of-art-and-culture">Urban regenerations and the role of art and culture</h3>
								<p>In capitalist societies, the connection between art and urban regenerations is established as a model of producing a new class geography of the city.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn94" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Such connections have been made possible through the interpenetration of art and the entire social and cultural production mechanism under the conditions of the cultural colonization of life effected by capitalist production.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn95" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Under these circumstances, art has become a resource and one of the important places when it comes to constructing power. The historical genesis of the connection between art and the transformation of cities is linked to the context of the USA and the 1970’s, when art created the preconditions for the increase of real estate prices in reindustrialized cities<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn96" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> and thus for a new class recomposition of the city. In the districts where artists came to live, art studios and art galleries proliferated, and their symbolic capital increased the level of the rent, so that poorer inhabitants of such districts tended to move out, and were eventually followed by the artists themselves, who were replaced by richer city dwellers. Today, the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of class recomposition of cities have been generalized at the global level, and their mechanisms include manipulating <em>collective symbolic capital</em> as a new apparatus of capitalist accumulation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn97" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
								<p>In the local context, the establishment of connections between art and urban regenerations became possible with the forcible transformation of socialist Yugoslavia after the 1990’s and the establishment of new capitalist relations. This change was accompanied by the wartime destruction of cities – urbicide, the transformation of ownership structure from social to private ownership, the switch from self-management relations to capitalist-exploitative relations, the development of corruption mechanisms and the absence of regulations when it came to the acquisition of capital, deindustrialization, the pauperization of the population, as well as the destruction of the existing mechanisms for work in the domain of culture and art, and the implementation of a new art/entrepreneurial model. In the era of socialism, the development of cities was based on central urban planning, and the state was the chief investor and planner of the new modern socialist city, aimed at fulfilling the needs of the new socialist man. Today, the new initiators of <em>urban development</em> are private and corporate investors, acting in cooperation with the state, city administration, global financial institutions, civil society organizations, and also with artists and workers in the sphere of culture.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn98" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> This kind of <em>investor planning</em> is characterized by a continual search for a profitable terrain where a surplus of value can be achieved, which is controlled by particular elites. In such a situation, urban regenerations no longer represent merely an act of repairing the neglected parts of the city, but most often constitute a radical act of pulling down the existing buildings and building new ones. Such <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es are no longer a part of systematic thinking about cities. The idea and role of a general urban planning design almost matter not at all, for an investor who purchases a cheap plot of land, having previously deliberately lowered the building costs, will not have any great difficulties when it comes to changing the regulated function of that particular area. In this way, the city stops being a space where one strives to establish at least a nominal equality of its inhabitants, and becomes a space of drastic social and economic inequalities and tensions. The development of cities is promoted through new optimistic visions promising benefits for all. This urban optimism simultaneously hides the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of the creation of new class topography of the city, and a revengeful attitude towards those inhabitants who are not among the privileged ones.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn99" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
								<p>Art and culture become an instrument and accomplices in such <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es through the inclusion of <span class="importantword">creativity</span> as applied imagination in the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of producing optimistic urban visions. That is what metanarratives about creative industries, creative cities and creative economy are all about.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn100" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> In these narratives, culture and art are reduced to their economic function in the project of attracting investors, tourism and stimulating the economy through a reduction of labor costs and social contributions, giving a boost to the entrepreneurial model of work, privatization of culture and maximizing profit. On the one hand, it is an urban mantra, and on the other, it constitutes a social-economic and cultural policy. What is at work here is a complex mechanism that absorbs all the aspects of life in exercising control and exploitation in cities. In the local context and in other so-called transitional societies, the introduction of the cultural industry and the implementation of ideas about creative economy and creative city are viewed as an act of modernizing a <em>backward</em> society. The insufficient presence of such practices is explained by the incompatibility of the administrative, legal, banking and business systems in post-socialist countries with those of &quot;advanced economies&quot;.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn101" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> In countries of South-Eastern Europe, this <em>modernization model</em> is implemented through state policies, the policies of cultural institutions and missions such as the British Council or the Goethe Institute, and also as a business strategy of private investors. Thus big cities in Serbia are regenerated through European and local <em>policies</em> about creative cities, such as the <em>Belgradisation of Belgrade</em> project and Belgrade’s bid for a European Capital of Culture in 2020,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn102" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> as well as the latest EU cultural project entitled <em>Creative Europe</em>. Also, regeneration is carried out by organizing cultural, entertainment or sports events such as the Universiade or the Eurovision Song Contest, and through individual projects promoting cultural industries and art as a generator of urban regeneration <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn103" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> and a guarantor of social inclusion in their implementation. Such practices are aimed at creating an image of the city as an innovative, exciting, creative and safe place for living, playing and consumption, promising benefits for all, whereas what is, in fact, being planned is a city of walled fortresses wherein the elite and its way of life are to be reproduced.</p>
								<p>In the local context, since the 1990’s culture and art have become an instrument of <em>progressive</em> <em>EU</em> <em>policies</em> aimed at creating an environment conducive to effecting a transition to neoliberal <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> by way of carrying out the so-called <em>democratization of culture</em>, the proclaimed goal of which was to free art and culture from the patronage of the state and the Party, as a system which, allegedly, <em>a priori</em> jeopardizes the basic human rights and the potential for creative expression of individuals. What was produced in this <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> was a new entrepreneurial subject of the artist, one no longer protected through public financing but struggling for him/herself on the market.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn104" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> In this way, art was used as a convenient tool for <em>cultivating</em> people on the capitalist periphery. This neo-colonial <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> has not been finished yet. Today, it is reproduced in the sphere of the implementation of cultural industries and social-entrepreneurial art used in the project of a <em>new modernization</em> of local society, which is viewed as backward, and is particularly in evidence in the cases of instrumentalisation of art in the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of urban regenerations. A new profile of the artist that is promoted in this way is the entrepreneurial artist – artepreneur<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn105" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> who resolves problems in a non-linear and creative manner. He/she is a precarious worker who manages his/her human capital through self-employment from one project to another. The figure of artepreneur assumes a particularly important role in times of crisis, when it emerges, on the one hand, as a victim of the macroeconomic situation, and on the other, as a force that brings salvation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn106" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> In contemporary art, the very idea of emancipation and activism has become an issue related to entrepreneurship, and thereby, being placed in the service of capital, normalized to a great extent.</p>
								<h3 id="art-guided-urban-regenerations-in-belgrade">Art-guided urban regenerations in Belgrade</h3>
								<p>In Serbia, culture- and art-guided urban regenerations have been promoted over the course of the past decade, and the realization of such ideas has only intensified in the last few years. We find examples of practices of culture- and art-guided urban regenerations in Serbia in big cities, mostly in Belgrade, where the political, economic and cultural life of Serbia is centralized. The epicenter of such activities is in the area of Belgrade’s riverbanks, which is currently the most exclusive and profitable location in Belgrade. There has been interest in the areas on the banks of the Sava and Danube rivers for a number of years, and various projects prepared for that part of the city have reflected the political, economic and cultural climate in the newly established state. In early 1990, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts called an internal tender, within the framework of which the project “Water City” emerged, and in 1996 the Socialist Party of Serbia commissioned the project <em>Europolis</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn107" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> These projects have never been realized, but that part of the city has never stopped attracting the attention of new investors and the political parties in power, most often during the course of pre-election campaigns.</p>
								<p>The interest shown in Belgrade’s riverbanks is not accidental and does not concern only the attractiveness of the actual location. It also has to do with the systematic work aimed at creating a new identity for Serbia and Belgrade, in a place which, during the pre-socialist period, in the first half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, was projected to become the economic centre of the city.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn108" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> It was there that the history of capitalist Serbia was made, aiming to establish a continuity through a systematic erasure of the socialist history and the industrial development of this area. What is worrying about this is the fact that this old Belgrade was a city of enormous class differences, where more than 80% of the population lived in extreme poverty.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn109" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The riverbanks are also a place of memory engineering, connected with the recent history of the wars fought in the 1990’s on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, which represents a continuation of the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of historical revisionism in Serbia, without which a projection of Belgrade as a new European-Serbian urban centre for the higher classes is not possible. One of the first great state projects of the regeneration of that area was the renovation of Sava Square<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn110" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a>, which began by the expulsion of female sexual workers from the area, whose place was taken over by a new revisionist monument to all war victims and defenders of the homeland in the 1990-1999 period, thus equating victims and executioners, and continuing the tradition of forgetting the fact that the role of Serbia in those wars was that of an aggressor.</p>
								<p>Today, that profitable area has become a battlefield where two megaprojects vie for power: the project launched by the privately owned company the Port of Belgrade entitled <em>Water City</em>, and the project initiated by the Government of Serbia entitled <em>Belgrade on Water</em>. <em>Water City</em> is an elite settlement occupying an area of 96 hectares of land, whereas <em>Belgrade on Water</em> occupies a considerably larger area of around 950 hectares of land, for which, apart from housing, the building of business parks and a new port for yachts are also planned.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn111" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> By planning the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of urban regenerations and involving art and cultural industries in the local strategic plans, the new creators of optimistic visions wish to make Belgrade a part of the world market of cities and make up for the decline of economic activities in the city. The main social trump card of these projects is their promise to resolve the problem of unemployment by creating new jobs in the sphere of construction work during the realization phase, in the service sector of the new walled communities, and also in the sector of cultural industries, whereas what is happening in practice is a flexibilisation and deregulation of the procedures for investors and undertakers, coupled with a degradation of workers’ rights, which means an increasingly frantic exploitation of all those engaged on the projects. Experienced engineers of urban transformations, such as renowned world architects, as well as mayors of cities wherein such <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es have been practiced, have already been involved in the initiation of urban regeneration <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es through the projects <em>Water City</em> and <em>Belgrade on Water</em>. Thus the main designer of the <em>Water City</em> project is the studio of Daniel Libeskind, whose biography includes numerous projects through which similar <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es have been initiated in other cities, and the main consultant of the <em>Belgrade on Water</em> project is the well-known New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani, whose brutal class and racist cleansing of New York in the 1990’s is well known.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn112" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> The initial phases of both projects involve the use of art and cultural industries, which play the key role in the preparatory phase of changing the function of the area in question. They are a part of the marketing strategy for promoting its transformation, as well as a <em>guarantor of</em> <em>the social awareness</em> of new spatial transformations. These involve the projects <em>Soho in Belgrade</em>, <em>Mixer</em> and <em>Urban Incubator</em>.</p>
								<p>The project “Soho in Belgrade” was initiated by the Port of Belgrade company in 2012, as part of preparations for the realization of <em>Water City</em>. The project presupposed enabling artists with well-established reputations to use studios, free of charge, in one of the warehouses inside the port, located in Dunavska Street, which formerly belonged to the <em>Srbijateks</em> company. The aim of this joint initiative of tycoons and the art establishment was the creation of the so-called <em>Soho effect</em>. Over the past several years, this term has become a synonym for urban regenerations in a number of instances involving the relocation of art studios and artists’ flats to derelict part of cities in the hope of producing additional symbolic capital and thus initiating the accumulation of capital. In the case of the project <em>Soho in Belgrade</em>, the bringing of artists to the warehouse had another function in addition to the aforementioned one, namely, participation in the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of changing the purpose of the space where the port operator is located.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn113" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> What this is all about are the efforts of the <em>Worldfin</em> company to close down the port through a drastic reduction of its scope of business operations, and to effect a symbolic and legal change of its function, so as to be able to build a new luxury settlement on that plot of land. From the very start, the new owner wanted to hide the fact that, according to the general urban plan, that plot of land was designated to have an economic function, and that its privatization involved a port operator only. Through corruptive arrangements between political parties and tycoons, a change of the general urban plan was brought about, so that the function of that part of the city was changed from an economic one to a housing-commercial one. Further room for maneuvering was provided by the problem that arose over entering the city in the registry book as the owner of the said plot of land. To put it more precisely, the new owners made use of the fact that the city failed to observe the deadline and submitted incomplete documentation, and proclaimed that plot of land to be theirs. Apart from the change of the general urban plan, manipulation over entering the owner in the registry book and the reduction of the operative capacity of the port operator, art was also involved in the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of changing the function of that plot of land through the project <em>Soho in Belgrade</em>.</p>
								<p>That artists are activists operating in the service of local tycoons is evidenced by the situation that arose after the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy, acting upon a request submitted by the Anti-Corruption Council, passed a decision on evicting artists from the Port of Belgrade on account of irregularities in the procedure of allocating studios to artists. Artists from Soho mobilized themselves in defense of the owner of the Port, whom they presented to the public as a new patron of the arts who, as opposed to the state, provided artists with a <em>roof above their heads.</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn114" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a>&nbsp;It is a fact that the working conditions of artists, after the degradation of the socialist-era mechanisms that enabled artists to obtain a studio, had become almost unendurable. However, the artists in question here are not a part of the class of artists who do need help. These are successful artists-entrepreneurs, who are favorably positioned on the world art market, most of whom do have their own working space, whereas some of them do not live in Belgrade. These <em>Sohoite</em> artists constitute the embodiment of everything that the new art establishment represents today. These are positions that are defended through a return to aestheticism and individual expression as the main criterion of art. Within the framework of this kind of positioning, opportunism and commercialism become desirable characteristics and a generator of success. What is at work here is a reactionary artistic practice that is articulated in opposition to the domain of critical and contextual practices, with which it enters into an open conflict through its insistence on being separated from sociability as the measure of true art. In Belgrade’s Soho, studios were allocated to select elite artists, without anything in the nature of a public competition, which resulted in the exclusion of those artists who are engaged in non-market-oriented artistic practices, who are dependent on public financing and who do need a working space. This resulted in an unbridgeable gap on the art scene, which became visible to the public when the <em>Sohoites</em> organized a panel discussion at the Kolarac People’s University, in the course of which public interest was defended by a group of artists presenting themselves as <em>The World Communal Heritage</em>. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn115" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
								<p>To the present day, the artists in the service of tycoons have not been evicted from the studios in the <em>Srbijateks</em> warehouse, for the commission that is supposed to carry out their eviction has never inspected the site, which, once again, serves to hide the corruptive mechanisms in the state. The epilogue of the story about the Port of Belgrade commenced in August 2013, through the initiation of the bankruptcy procedure. Parallel with this, the Government of Serbia, through the representatives of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party, embarked on a new campaign of promoting the project <em>Belgrade on Water</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn116" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> It is important to point out that a part of the project <em>Belgrade on Water</em> is being planned on the plot of land held by the operator of the Port of Belgrade, which sheds more light on why the bankruptcy procedure is being initiated right now, despite the efforts of the Anti-Corruption Agency of many years to point out the irregularities surrounding the privatization and operation of that company. In this case, it would appear that the more powerful bureaucrats have used the tycoons to close down the port operations in order to take over a part of the land already prepared for this purpose.</p>
								<p>Even though the project <em>Belgrade on Water</em> was presented to the public only midway through 2013, systematic preparations for its implementation have been carried out for several years, by engaging art and cultural industries in the district which, by means of the fabrication of tradition, has become known again under the name of Savamala. The model of regeneration being implemented in Savamala today is based on an attempt to introduce a creative economy through creative industries, within the framework of a project of increasing the symbolic capital of the place and resolving the problem of economic deficit through <em>creativisation</em> and artistic-communal-participatory-social entrepreneurship with a view to normalizing the situation of social dissatisfaction, as well as a new legitimization of the history of the place. These <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es were not initiated by the city authorities but by <em>independent</em> cultural initiatives, in cooperation with business groups and with the German cultural mission – the Goethe Institute. Still, the city and municipal authorities support the initiatives undertaken through budget financing, allowing the use of space owned by the city, and through affirmation by means of projects of establishing creative economies and producing a creative city such as <em>Belgrade 2020</em>, which accompanies Belgrade’s bid for a European Capital of Culture.</p>
								<p>The introduction and affirmation of cultural industries and stimulation of the development of entrepreneurial creative economy as a form of social activism and struggle for the revitalization of Savamala is a task set by the project <em>Mixer</em>, which includes the eponymous festival and the newly opened venue <em>Mixer House</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn117" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Even though <em>Mixer</em> proposes a model of partnership with the business sector, as a practice of the <em>de-etatization</em> of the creative sector and its <em>liberation</em>, in a parallel development public budget funds are invested in the project through a number of public companies and funds, which clearly shows a switch in the domain of public financing – from support given to critical practices to support given to commercial initiatives. The idea of <em>Mixer</em> is to turn Belgrade into a Balkan creative centre and incubator for young creative talents by developing the concept of the creative city with a nucleus in the industrial zone that is losing its function. What is at work here are efforts aimed at the accumulation of symbolic capital in Savamala through the promotion of established creators and entertainers, and through a frantic exploitation of all those who are not privileged. The ethics of entrepreneurial inventiveness is used to hide the issue of the precarious work conditions of those who do not belong to the top echelon, their enforced volunteer work and the imposition of hierarchical models, and often the investment of the personal funds of young artists during the realization of works that are featured in the programmes of “Mixer”. On the other hand, “Mixer” is also a form of incubator for producing an army of creative workers who are supposed to set the creative industry in motion, as a sphere that is broader than cultural industries, in the domain of a new urbanization of Belgrade. <em>Mixer</em> is deeply involved in the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of the so-called &quot;creative destruction <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn118" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> through initiating new mechanisms for the accumulation of capital in the course of paving the way for the arrival of investors and the building of <em>Water City</em>. It is one of those entrepreneurial tactics that glorifies the successes of individuals and neglects the failures of the majority, and instead of new social networks, it offers alienated consumerism. What is created in this way is a false promise of creating new <em>authentic</em> relations, paving the way for capitalist uniformity at all levels.</p>
								<p>Parallel with <em>Mixer</em>, the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of urban regenerations in Savamala are also initiated using a somewhat different method, through the practices of communal-participative-social art, as a subgroup of the creative sector, which are realized within the framework of the Goethe Institute project <em>Urban Incubator</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn119" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> <em>Urban Incubator</em> was presented as a participative model of urban development, whose aim is to improve the quality of life of the local population and to <em>democratize</em> the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of decision-making by means of a higher degree of involvement of the inhabitants of the district. The project is a short-term one, will last one year, and during that time it should accumulate symbolic capital and increase the market value of the district, following which the artists will withdraw, leaving room for the coming of investors and the development of tourism. <em>Urban Incubator</em> represents an attempt at implementing the <em>Western model</em> of culture-guided urban regeneration in the local context (of the eleven projects that were accepted in the competition, only two were initiated by local artists and architects), and has been recognized as such by the local city authorities and the municipality of Savski venac – as having potential for the <em>development</em> of Savamala.</p>
								<p>Realizing projects within the framework of <em>Urban Incubator</em>, the artists engaged assume the competencies of urban planners, social workers, ethnographers and researchers, and pass themselves off as experts when it comes to reinventing the space of Savamala through interventions in public space, collecting personal stories from the community, participative design, <em>crowdsourcing</em>, designing small businesses and micro factories with a view to enlivening the area and engaging people from the local community in order to establish a continuity with the entrepreneurial history of the place. Such an artistic practice represents a specific architecture of the community that includes economic exchange, civic life, public property and the establishment of various new connections. What is evident about this project is that it privileges participative art as a tool for cosmetic interventions aimed at resolving the systemic problems of Savamala, or even resorting to enforced participation or imposing parameters of art projects onto the inhabitants of Savamala with the intention of &quot;beautifying their living space and increasing the market value of their flats&quot;.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn120" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> This coupling points to the ideological subtext of participative-social-entrepreneurial artistic practices, which can be defined as a <em>culturalisation of politics</em> or a dislocation of discourse on complex and provocative social and political topics into the sphere of culture and art.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn121" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> “Urban Incubator” is a symptom of social architects’ <em>paranoid fear</em> of social unrest, and they engage art as a <em>dependable means</em> of pacifying the accumulated dissatisfaction of the inhabitants of Savamala, offering them a promise of a better life, all the while, in fact, paving the way for the arrival of real estate traders and opening more and more nightclubs and cafés.</p>
								<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
								<p>The transformation of the existing socialist structures and mechanisms of cultural and artistic production, as well as the abandonment of certain projects of sociability, the diminishing and increasingly non-transparent public financing and the devastation of cultural institutions, as well as giving in to the operation of the market forces, have created conditions that are unendurable for the vast majority of artists and workers in the sphere of culture. Seemingly paradoxically, the public and investors give their support to the art establishment and initiatives that promote <em>apolitical</em> entrepreneurial artistic-designer practices. The creation of such conditions has produced a fertile soil for manipulation and instrumentalisation of art by the state and its powerful bureaucrats, tycoons and their firms and corporations, the cultural missions of national European states and the broader EU policies, as well as local cultural entrepreneurs who believe that they are on their way to becoming capitalists.</p>
								<p>As has been shown in the local context and in countries of the periphery, what is at work here is practicing certain creative-economic models of regeneration of cities in the name of the <em>modernization</em> and <em>democratization</em> of local society and its economy, within the framework of which are intertwined <em>national and neo-colonial modernization</em>, which act as accomplices in the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of producing the spaces of capitalist periphery. What this is about is the implementation of new neoliberal regimes of producing cities and creating conditions for producing a new class geography in spaces where there are still populations of different social and economic status living together, and, naturally enough, the production of new mechanisms of flexibilisation of work and legislation in a project wherein the local environment continues to be produced as a resource for <em>the developed world</em>, and which is kept under control by means of carefully measured loans which create a condition of <em>debt slavery</em>. Through the use of art, culture and the cultural industry, <em>Western models</em> of urban regenerations are implemented, the intention being to produce a quick effect of changing the function of the given space, increasing its symbolic capital, producing a new <em>identity</em> of the city, introducing new forms of capitalist economy, as well as normalizing potential social conflicts.</p>
								<p>Still, despite their above-mentioned instrumental function in the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of reshaping cities, art, <span class="importantword">creativity</span> and culture can also represent significant factors of the destabilization of such <em>smooth</em> <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of capital-guided urban transformation, and can participate in producing a city based on different and more egalitarian relations, outside the proven exploitative relations of power and division of labor. For them to be established as such, it is necessary, to begin with, to articulate a radical class critique of the (newly established) capitalist relations in formerly socialist cities in Serbia, as well as a critique of the use of art and culture, and also to be engaged in continual theoretical-activistic-political work on producing different relations, which are anxiously articulated today through certain local practices in a state of <em>insobriety</em> produced by the social transformation and the new rules of the game wherein (artistic and cultural) activism becomes an instrument of capital.</p>

								<p>A maxim constantly repeated by the Ljubljana Mayor in the last few years has been “Ljubljana – the most beautiful city in the world”. The sentence condenses the dominant urbanistic managerial ideology of the Municipality of Ljubljana (hereafter MOL): the ideology of consumerist attractiveness. The grandiose urban plans following this directive are transforming the city into a postcard in order to send it and sell it, especially to the urban tourism industry which clings to the public image-making as well as to other formations of capital. The straightjacketing of the public space into lucrative, sterile, and disciplinary logic is not anything new. Yet some strategies of the neoliberal urbanism in city espoused with the reproduction of capital seem to be the new ones. Whereas the cultural consumption was fuelling the city’s symbolic economy<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn122" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> for quite a while, the cities in the 21st century strain themselves to become areas of peculiar multifaceted production closely intertwined with consumption once again .This time they are shaping a pervasive marketing coalition between the cultural and art establishments, real estate speculators, service business, and city councils.</p>
								<p>The contemporary urban tourism industry ceases to have the privileged sole position of the producer of surplus value in the metropolis. Instead, the neoliberal capital colonization is invading new spheres and ways of surplus extraction, while mimicking the ideological <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of gentrification under “new planetary vulgates”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn123" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a>, such as the territorial “creative milieu”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn124" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a>or the metropolitan “creative city”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn125" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> The proponents of such “new urban economy”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn126" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a>tend to blindly follow Florida’s nostrum of the new paradigm for urban planning that can be found his all-encompassing predicament: “Human <span class="importantword">creativity</span> is the ultimate source of economic growth”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn127" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> The territorial intertwines with the cognitive colonization only to become a situated “creative economy” in the era of cognitive <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>.</p>
								<p>We can witness the entire trajectory of these <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es through the case of a former bicycle factory in Ljubljana. Located in immediate vicinity of the city centre, the Rog factory operated until 1991, then remained closed and abandoned until 2006,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn128" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> when, after 15 long years of stagnation, the group TEMP, along with a conglomerate of other praxes and realities,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn129" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> reclaimed the factory for temporary use and brought the Fordist Frankenstein back to life. From 2010 onwards, the reappropriation of the commons was claimed. Ever since their liberation and reanimation, the spaces in Rog² present an open cultural, social, and political hub giving shelter to a multitude of autonomous collective political subjects<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn130" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> as well as to a broad range of artists and sports enthusiasts practicing horizontal organization and communication on a daily basis.</p>
								<p>In order to demonstrate how the paradigmatic shift to postfordist cognitive <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> is taking place and form in Ljubljana, I divided the article into three sections. It starts by introducing the project based on a public-private partnership bearing the name Second Chance,then highlighting its initial intentions with the autonomous Rog and the neoliberal discourse while advocating creative industries, urban regeneration etc. After problematizing the premises of the “new urban economy” and of the designed emplacement of cognitive <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>, the article focuses on pilot project RogLab which is seen as a pervasive creation of creative industries installed in the interim phase between the unveiling of the megalomaniac plans and their implementation by the owner of the factory, MOL. The third and concluding instance deals with the changed spatial design, showing the proposed publically financed gradual construction, or rather demolition, of the liberated Rog factory which has, in fact, the purpose of neutralization and eradication of the autonomous collective <span class="importantword">creativity</span> in Rog, giving space to gentrification.</p>
								<h3 id="the-public-private-partnership-model-as-a-pan-european-paradigm-of-gentrification-second-chance">The Public-Private Partnership Model as a Pan-European Paradigm of Gentrification: Second Chance</h3>
								<p>Starting with the year 2010, MOL’s endeavour to castrate Rog was wrapped inside a benevolent cellophane, launched under the name the Second Chance. The former Rog factory joined other postindustrial sites including the former AEG factory (Nuremberg), HALLE 14 of the former Cotton Spinning Mill (Leipzig), the tram depot (Krakow) and the Arsenale (Venice). In order to understand the vulgar slogan of Second Chance “from industrial use to creative impulse” we shall dwell directly on the project’s description:</p>
								<p>[The slogan] [i]t is a vision of five European cities to transform a disused industrial site into a cultural and creative work and living space and continuing their revitalisation with sustainable concepts. […] Nuremberg, Leipzig, Venice, Krakow and Ljubljana work together<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn131" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> to develop innovative strategies and concepts to upgrade their former industrial site to a key cultural linchpin of the city’s district. The cities face the same challenges of developing a heritage and former industrial sites. Even though the revitalisation <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> is at different stages in the five cities, the partners share the same questions, challenges, opportunities and goals. […]<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn132" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
								<p>According to the initial plan, and through the private-public partnership model, the buildings would be levelled first to the ground, and then, once the ruins were cleaned up, the Centre of Contemporary Arts was to be planned on top. To complement this grotesque picture, the entire Rog’s surface (around 7,000 square meter) was to be split into private (80.69%) and public (19.31%) ownership, whereby the private “content” would comprise a residential (apartments, underground garages), hotel and business section, while the public part were to be exclusively reserved for <em>creative industries</em> (multi-purpose halls, exhibition surfaces, studios etc.).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn133" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> The logic behind the two bedfellows under neoliberalism is that the public would finance the private and the private would parasite on public benefits. The ideological premises nesting in the plan were in the apparent satisfaction of both sectors: the private sector with profit-making spaces and pseudopublic spaces as non-profit contents were to be designed for the public.</p>
								<p>However, the unveiled case of the expropriation of the commons is far from being satisfactory. It is necessary to scale the whole problem on the level of new urban regime which does not necessarily cling any longer on the art world, as it symptomatically proposes to erect the Centre of Contemporary Arts as well as spaces for arts and culture to be featured inside. To expand a Hannah Arendt’s thought into the milieu of “creative <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>”, the privatization of the public <em>and</em> the commons is intimately connected to the privatization of the political. And to put it differently, gentrification through art was complemented with the gentrification through “<span class="importantword">creativity</span>”. The culturalization of capital under a new panacea for post-industrial sites means: creative “revitalisation through arts and culture”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn134" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
								<p>Generally speaking, gentrification can manifest in three forms: traditional, modern, and artificial.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn135" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> The traditional one is produced by exploiting historical and social “guardians of collective symbolic and cultural capital (the museums, the universities, the class of benefactors, and the state apparatus)”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn136" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> The modern one is produced by exploiting the art world and urban subcultures as the artificial gentrification is a strategy generated by city councils through public campaigns which promote the creative city in order to attract investments and highly skilled workers. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn137" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Concomitantly, the “[q]uality of urban life has become a commodity, as has the city itself, in a world where consumerism, tourism, cultural and knowledge-based industries have become major aspects of the urban political economy”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn138" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
								<p>What remains overshadowed is the mode of accumulation of the <em>collective symbolic capital</em>. This capital, after Slovenia’s transition to neoliberalism, was not exploited due to MOL’s active negation of the autonomous cultural production in Rog today. In this sense, neither squatters nor artists or other users of the postindustrial Rog had the role of “bridge gentrifiers”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn139" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a>, i.e. transitional tenants, who would be tolerated only until they raised property value. For example, in Lower East Side (New York City) “[t]he artists were pioneers of gentrification in this new frontier for the middle class, by creating an art scene and community, combining the use of their space for living, producing, performing and exhibiting.”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn140" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
								<p>Instead of what Zukin<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn141" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> termed “artistic mode of production”, the parasitism through which the Second Chance has been building upon its campaign, is availing to the emplaced and sediment collective symbolic capital. It also accumulated during the socialistic industrial era and strongly underlined the embedded collective memory. The “unique cultural assets”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn142" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> of the former Rog industrial complex are in fact just “[...] special marks of distinction that attach to some place, as they have a significant drawing power upon the flows of capital more generally.”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn143" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Concisely, claims to the uniqueness yield monopoly rent.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn144" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
								<p>I shall underline here another passage from the project’s description: “The cities face the same challenges of <em>developing a heritage and landmarked former industrial sites</em>”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn145" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> The claim indicates that the accumulation of the <em>collective symbolic capital</em> would combine a symbolic musealisation of the localized “unique” socialist remains <em>with</em> the outlined cultural capital (the projected art spaces and institutions) <em>in order to</em>, lastly, pave the way for capital accumulation under the banner of creative industries. Thus, the traditional way of gentrification will intertwine the (pseudo)modern and the artificial form.</p>
								<p>One of the premises of the pan-European Second Chance is therefore purely teleological: the cognitariat would superimpose the bygone proletariat which once laboured in these spaces spanning from shipbuilders to bicycle factory workers. What is a better way to illuminate the triumph of the bright “progressive” <span class="importantword">capitalism</span> over the obscure “archaic” socialism? Here also could fit the statement of the MOL’s Head of Department for Culture expressed at the unveiling of the new plans (which will be discussed in more detail later). According to her, Rog will become a point of interest for the new generation of young architects and designers, which will “get in the city centre a space and tools for entering the labour market”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn146" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
								<p>Moreover, by perpetually referring to the <em>disused</em> and <em>(former) Rog factory</em> the Second Chance is not only imaginarily discarding the emplaced collective body from the past of a Yugoslav industrial flagship, but rather the recuperation is broadened onto the semantic level with a metonymy, castling the factory’s original denomination (i.e. Rog) and by continuously repeating the Rog’s (distorted) condition. The capitalist exploitation coated itself in “<span class="importantword">creativity</span>” abandoning the division between former/present, as the case of Rog shows. The denial of this binarity is necessary, or else the legitimacy of subjectivities present within Rog would be acknowledged.</p>
								<p>In this view, an left-out part of the Second Chance description is to be understood: “[These postindustrial sites are] the industrial estates who deserve this 2nd chance”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn147" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> The positioning of the Second Chance in the linear continuation of the paternalistic logic of urbanism (the anthropomorphized discourse of giving estates a second opportunity)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn148" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> is actively denying the collective reappropiation of the space in 2006 as well as it is denying the ongoing manifold autonomous cultural, social, and political production being housed in the buildings.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn149" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> This attempt to revive a space already revived<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn150" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a>can signal only one thing: creative industries will lie on the ashes of autonomous collective <span class="importantword">creativity</span>. One could go that far to delineate the latter as a fetishist urban necrophilia: the compulsive reuse of the moribund object-factory as a stimulus of capital consolation (or better yet, accumulation). It is an object to which either any of the current vivacity is apathetically negated, either to which the emancipating collective <span class="importantword">creativity</span> will be institutionally euthanatized by turning it into an urban corpse – or only to be repossessed later. Once the collective creative capital failed to undergo capitalist valorisation, the only attraction left to the capital and managerial establishment is to cling to the cadaveric proletarian collective “body”.</p>
								<p>Pointed out by Pasquinelli, Harvey’s <em>collective symbolic capital</em> can be conceived as another name for the “<em>capitalist exploitation of the commons</em> – a form of exploitation that does not need violent enclosures”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn151" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> Here the notion of violence deserves further attention. Ever since Rog’s reappropriation, MOL is intentionally leaving Rog in deficient circumstances, without the minimal material conditions; ever since the reappropriation the whole complex is functioning in abstraction of electricity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn152" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> Rog’s users are quotidianly experiencing systematic exhaustion, longitudinal vegetation on their bodies, and, generally, the menace of eviction – all instances of subtle structural violence strongly calling into question the presumed no-violence-policy of capital exploitation.</p>
								<p>Now I can focus on the postulation regarding the <em>exploitation of the commons.</em> We are faced with the notion of the exploited commons, which is easily applicable to the enunciated capitalistic mode of production as immaterial, pertaining to cognitive, affective labour. This appears be the position after the implementation of Second Chance, turning Rog from a closedown factory into an immaterial social factory. Again, according to the description the project’s intention is: “[...] to transform a disused industrial site in a <em>cultural and creative</em> <em>work and living space</em> [...]”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn153" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> The phrase quintessentially comprises the concept of bio-political production, in which all spheres of social life are produced: “[...] post-Fordism and the immaterial paradigm of production adopt performativity, communication, and collaboration as central characteristics”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn154" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> Perhaps this is an opportune time to fasten more particularly the pervasive creation of the creative industries.</p>
								<h3 id="in-the-white-cube-a-simulacrum-of-the-creative-industries-roglab-centre-pilot-project">In the White Cube, a Simulacrum of the Creative Industries: RogLab Centre Pilot Project</h3>
								<p>The capital’s colonization of the public spaces and the commons once was exemplified in 2012 with the so called RogLab Centre Pilot Project. Installed as a plot investment of the Second Chance project and located on the embankment directly across the street from Rog, RogLab takes a shape of an entirely white cargo container. Here we have a double interpretation of an object pioneering the local creative industries, offering itself. The white container cannot be seen only as the advocate of the White Cube and thus flagging the penetration of the new “creative” urban economy; the container is simultaneously a prime example of a boxed up neoliberalism through which the mantra of free movements of goods, capital, services and people, is transmitted around the globe. By analogy with Giddens’ the conceptualization of the state as a territorial (bordered) power-container, RogLab strains in presenting itself as an unconfined “creative” power container and a dynamo for the creative economy:</p>
								<p>RogLab is conceived as a production, educational and presentation space in a 30 m²‑container object. It is dedicated to activities in the fields of architecture, design and contemporary art, their mutual connecting and cross-sector collaboration (economy, education, science, environment, space…) as well as international networking.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn155" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
								<p>RogLab’s spatial separation from the Rog building by being <em>outside</em> yet <em>in face of</em> it, does not mean its contents are hermetically encapsulated or, at first glance, antithetic to those nourished in Rog.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn156" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> Quite to the contrary: this act of colonization of the public space means as well the colonization of <span class="importantword">creativity</span> by being the epistemological and material forerunner of the creative industries in the area. For example, RogLab is openly acknowledging the devastation of Rog; it promotes to be “an attractive mobile architecture [...] marking the beginning of the renovation of the former Rog factory. The pilot project will function as a small scale model of the future Rog Centre”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn157" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
								<p>Further, on the external surface of RogLab an imprinted characterization reads: “In the 3D workshop for fast prototyping, we help you <em>develop ideas into tangible products</em>”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn158" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Thus, the neoliberal capitalist paradigm of productive knowledge is canalized into an applicable and vendible market form. “Neoliberalism,” asserts Harvey<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn159" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> “[…] proposes that human well-being can best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade. The role of the state is to create and preserve an institutional framework appropriate to such practices.”</p>
								<p>Taken together, Rog<em>Lab</em> can indeed be viewed as <em>labor-</em>atorial, a laboratorial materialization reflecting the intertwined <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es of the capitalist rent parasiting on the productive commons,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn160" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> incorporation of existent subversion, commodification of autonomous collective <span class="importantword">creativity</span>, and the (forerunner and justifier of) spatial usurpation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn161" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> The paradigmatic workshop/art project “Socialdress” carried out in RogLab might be the utmost illustration of these <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es <em>in vitro</em>. Championing the creative industries, the workshop sucked out the labour of unemployed women who were voluntarily embroidering clothes for several days:</p>
								<p>This art project […] takes place in the form of a clothes and household fabrics fashion collection. The collection incorporates slogans from the recent Slovenian protests<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn162" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> – the expression of the general public’s rebellion and dissatisfaction with the existing system. Modern embroidery machines will be used to embroider the selected slogans onto fabrics and clothes, thus empowering them. Traditional craft skills, modern technology, fashion, social engagement, activism and social entrepreneurship all join forces in this new interdisciplinary art project [...].<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn163" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>
								<p>The machine of commodification, which mimics under the coat of benevolence and social responsibility, attempted to decontextualize and castrate the collective subversive potentiality of the uprisings by aestheticisation and banalization, vampirizing the free labour: “The [Socialdress] project promotes and supports sewing e.g. dress home-making. It transforms the sewing into an entertaining and useful social activity”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn164" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> Here, the unpaid social cooperation, the mutual production, and interdisciplinary collaboration all go a step further from the individualism inherent to the anatomized precariat. The neoliberal machine does not base its agenda anymore on explicit exclusion, but rather on the controlled inclusion – preferably the collective one. In this vein, it is necessary to mention the emphasis of the Second Chance on the newly incarnated neoliberal species, who do not go under the name stockholders or shareholders but stakeholders instead. According to Marx’s general intellect or to Kropotkin’s mutual aid, a neoliberal counterpart is allocated and linked with the fabrication of consent through a Habermassian ideal communication and rational discourse. Throughout the practice of the Second Chance, the colonization of the commons goes hand in hand with the adoption of the formalized “inclusive bottom-up participatory” smokescreen.</p>
								<h3 id="gentrification-goes-public">Gentrification Goes Public</h3>
								<p>What was to be witnessed in 2013 was another twist in the neoliberal municipal urban policies. In the explication of the changed spatial plan for Rog, under the heading “<em>Assessment of the situation, causes and aims why the document is necessary</em>” the scenario runs: since the initial blueprint was approved, the situation, especially economic, has been changing and the arrangement of Rog’s area to the extent of the previous spatial plan was no longer possible. In reality, no private investor was willing to take part in the Second Chance, thereby decelerating the entire <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of the execution; indeed, an irony derived directly out of the global financial crisis. Neither the downfall of a private-public partnership or the subsequent resignation of capital did not bury the peculiar spatial voracity. Notwithstanding the financial deficit and the public debt, the construction pretence is now to be orchestrated by the municipality independently of the investments from the private sector.</p>
								<p>Therefore, a changed spatial plan was proposed enabling the construction in several stages. More accurately, a seven-phased (re)construction is now being designed. In the first stage of the construction, the blueprint includes two crucial interventions: the “outside arrangement” around the central building <em>and</em> an underground garage overlapping with the position of almost all buildings on the territory of Rog.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn165" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> In all likelihood, the planned besiegement of the central building and the “outside arrangement” will manifest itself directly in the form of an internal reconstruction of the main factory outbuilding, leaving behind another “late capitalist hollow space”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn166" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>
								<p>As for the surrounding buildings without the historical preservation,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn167" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> which itself allows façadism— and the demolishment of the building’s interior yet leaving its exterior intact— these will be levelled to the ground, causing another symptomatic fenced urban void, filled at the best with gravelled parking spaces, as this profitable emptiness is the <em>modus operandi</em> for architectural shortfalls in the city. What would evidently distinguish it from other urban voids caused by the lack of investments is contained in the intention of transforming the building into a politically silent urban phantom. The eviction of users, the fencing off potential occupants, and seclusion are all practical strategies of de-politization. In other words, the complete resignation from the project remains unimaginable since gentrification operates in a broader urban context. With the restructuration into a “postindustrial creative site” though, the refashioned Rog factory will, at best, become the situated gravitational field for gentrification, as the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span> of gentrification will inevitably include the entire surrounding neighbourhood.

								<span class="author">Irmgard Emmelheinz</span><span class="words"> | 2.105 words | <a href="#"><span class="importantword">creativity</span></a>, <a href="#">Capital</a>, <a href="#">Abstraction</a></span>
								<p>In Mexico, advanced neoliberal reforms are taking place at a much faster pace than in other parts of the world. These reforms have delivered not only new forms of life and making a living but also new sensibilities. The erosion of the social contract brought by these reforms, has had tangible (all negative) effects on the social tissue. This has materialized, for example, in what is known as the most violent and dangerous city in the world, Ciudad Juárez, where in 2010 alone, 3000 people were killed. Bearing this in mind, I am defining neoliberalism as a <em>sensibility</em> that shapes subjectivities, permeates art and culture, differentiates and homogenizes people, molds lives and desires, mistakes information for knowledge, gives shape to space and thus to social relations, normalizes violence, creates ways of seeing the world giving shape to common sense that justifies destruction and dispossession with notions progress and development, or that tries to solve economic precarity with self-help and permanent education. I argue that neoliberalism is more than a system that is ruled by a free market economy, which implies the privatization of the welfare state and an array of government services (for example: education, health, energy), subcontracting to the private sector and changes in labor laws and worker’s rights as well as a transnational division of labor. The system of control under neoliberalism combines a militarized police regime with repressive tolerance, the logic of securitization with granting freedom of expression and ‘quality of life.’ The political figures, molded and governed by the neoliberal regime itself are: <em>homo oeconomicus</em> (or entrepreneur, responsible for his own well-being and manager of his own human capital) and the subject of rights (the State is in charge of guaranteeing that his human rights are respected). Aside from an economic-political system, I see neoliberalism as a way of relating to the world, to nature, to things and beings, which presupposes unlimited growth and development. It is also a way of living and working: human beings are being put to work beyond their capacities, erasing the distinction between the leisure and work time. Neoliberalism is also a sensibility that establishes the terms of empathy and sympathy and has outlined a new notion of alterity. Configured as ‘social responsibility’ or social work, to ‘help’ the Other means to focus on the (so-called) ‘secondary malfunctions’ of the current capitalist system by disseminating personal and managerial practices such as tolerance, showing respect, nurturing dialogue, transparency and social collaboration. In this sense, the “Other” is a ‘community to come,’ the ‘subject of rights’ (and to ethical restitution: refugees, displaced, immigrants, those who live under a ‘state of exception’), the <em>underclass</em>, that is, he or she who will be permanently outside globalizing <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>, including access to education, jobs and consumption. The category of the “Other” encompasses as well, political and religious fundamentalists, fanatics who are outside globalizing and modernizing <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es by choice. These <em>Others</em> are sometimes given faces in the media or in art by spectacularizing their subjectivity but obviating the <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es that placed them in those very situations that render their lives precarious and endangered in the first place.</p>
								<p>What has this got to do with the autonomy of art? As we will see, with postmodernism, art and culture came to be at the center of social, political and economic <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es and are now inextricable from work, production, consumption and subjectivity: in the neoliberal regime, art in particular and culture in general are being used actively as compensation and improvement of tools, normalizing and spreading the antithesis of autonomous art, that is, ‘useful art.’ Subsumed to political action, much of contemporary art has taken up a political role as either ‘sensible politics’ or ‘socially engaged artwork.’ This is tied to the fact that in our current world order, as Vishmidt and Stakemeier point out, “Art no longer designates a reproductive and representational realm, but one of productivity and social power” and thus the autonomy of art itself has become a problem – in so far as it has become a realm for the production of added value.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn171" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a></p>
								<p>In the September 2013 editorial of <em>e-flux journal</em>, the editors stated that art is produced at a double bind: while art can be complicit or instrumentalized by power, its autonomy is located in an imaginary space. What do they mean by this? First, that art, in order to be <em>seen</em>, depends on a platform – an institution – and thus needs to be part of some art world. Second, that the autonomy of art – as a separate regime or an isolated sphere – is a fantasy. In order to consider the autonomy of art outside of this double bind, Clement Greenberg tied the autonomy of art – as art’s for art’s sake – to the avant-garde situating criticality within the discipline or medium of art itself. Clearly taking a position against socialist realist painting and those debates of the 1930s relying on the relationship between art and politics (embodied for example, by socialist realism or Mexican muralist painting, which was very popular in New York in the 1930s) in Greenberg’s definition, avant-garde (Modernist) painting was characterized by self-critique in the sense that its formal expression is a meditation on the qualities of the medium of painting. This meant extricating figuration from the arts, and an essentialist understanding of the mediums of art: for Greenberg, ‘purity’ was political – especially if it was seen as an embodiment of a free nation versus the authoritarian Soviet Union.</p>
								<p>Postmodernism could be understood as an effort to break with Greenberg’s disciplinary totalitarianism. Taking up the Dadaist and surrealist avant-garde’s goals of unifying art and life, postmodernism thrived with the advent of interdisciplinary strategies and in the symbiosis of art with everything else. Post-war art continued the vanguardist critique of the bourgeois notions of autonomous art and expressive artists, embracing everyday objects, transforming the artist’s function, questioning the institution of art or attacking it in the anarchist manner.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn172" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> Following Hal Foster, art from the 1950s and 1960s represents the failure to destroy the institution of art and the institutionalization of the avant-garde.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn173" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> If Greenberg advocated aesthetic autonomy with the purpose of resisting illustrational meanings prone to kitsch and commercial forces, post-modernist’s inter disciplinary strategies led art, in Foster’s words, “to become embedded into life under the terms of mass <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>, while it became appropriated by the culture industry.”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn174" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> Due to its ‘post-medium’ condition, as Rosalind Krauss termed ‘postmodern interdisciplinarity,’ art is enmeshed with reality, and its materials can range from social interaction, scientific research, montage, etc. With postmodernism, the politics of the autonomy of art meant breaking away from in Greenberg’s sense of purity and thus art’s autonomy came to be conceived as “provisional, always defined diacritically (as something supplemental to art) and situated politically, always <em>semi</em>.”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn175" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a></p>
								<p>Beyond postmodernism, parallel to the increase of corporate subsidy to the arts, there has been a recent boom in private collecting and thus a market boom; the value of art is speculative and reflects the logic of finance-based economy (and risk), and the economy and critical art share the core value of ‘innovation.’ In this regard, neoliberalism has meant for the arts privatization or the collusion between the private and the public sector in order to subsidize them. In the past decade or so (and in the US long before that), corporations have played an important role in investing in culture, as institutions and corporations seek to play an important role in communicating the private sector point of view on an array of critical public topics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn176" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> If art was previously supported by the state, because culture was considered to be an asset to the nation, today, corporations have appropriated this function, as they sponsor and jury art shows, grant awards and funds and collect artworks. Meanwhile, they promote their perspective on critical public topics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn177" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> In a 1998 article, art historian Chin-tao Wu highlighted how corporations appropriated the concept of innovation – also known as innovative disruption or creative destruction – in order to redefine its meaning in corporate terms. She quotes Philip Morris Inc.’s – the U.S. cigarette company – executive vice-president, John Murphy, on their sponsorship of the 1969 exhibition, <em>When Attitudes Become Form</em>:</p>
								<p>…We feel it is appropriate that we participate in bringing these works to the attention of the public, for there is a key element in this ‘new art’ which has its counterpart in the business world. That element is <em>innovation</em> – without which it would be impossible for progress to be made in any segment in society.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn178" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a></p>
								<p>Furthermore, in the context of neoliberal reforms and sensibility, there is a global tendency to subdue contemporary art to the politics of culture administration, which implies “democratizing culture” making it accessible to the masses, using it as a tool for the well-being of society, for the reconstruction or healing of a community or society that has experienced violence. Cultural institutions subsidized by corporations and individual patrons apparently follow progressive agendas promoting political – or socially minded art. For instance, <em>Creative Time</em> in New York (funded by a mix of state and corporate support) supports public and community art, with the goal of enabling the politicization of social space with cultural intervention. This organization sponsored Tania Bruguera’s “Immigrant Movement International,” a project developed in Queens (2011), New York, which the artist describes as: a flexible community space and long-term socio-political movement, public workshops, events, actions and partnerships with immigrant and service organizations; the artist further qualified her project as “useful art.”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn179" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> The problem is that initiatives such as this one, render opaque the real economic conditions that led to situations of immigrant precarity to begin with: immigrants are local signs of complex global forces operating on their conditions of life and work at home and abroad. Many would argue that subsidy to projects like Bruguera’s signals the transfer of social work to artistic work funded by the private sector. In regards to this, politics comes into the scene through art as social work in the name of ‘public interest,’ only to become subject to administration, engineering and a technocratic way of administering social problems, configuring the private version of the welfare state.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn180" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> Furthermore, as the corporate support to the establishment of antagonistic spaces becomes gradually institutionalized within society, the question rises, after Gregory Sholette , “Who owns cultural capital and who has the right to use it?” .</p>
								<p>As for him, corporate involvement in the arts is akin – or perhaps integral to – to the current erosion of public space.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn181" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> Moreover, as cultural spaces become institutional bastions of democratic self-expression and sites for social reconciliation and self-help, dissent is criminalized and forcefully punished worldwide.</p>
								<p>It becomes evident that in the neoliberal globalized world, art and culture are central to neoliberal <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es as agents of globalization, as tools for improvement and development, counterinsurgency and pacification. An extreme example could be the ‘culturally sensible’ occupation of Iraq as described by Nato Thompson (director of <em>Creative Time</em>). In uncritical terms, Thompson recounts how General David Petraeus wrote a field manual geared at changing people’s attitudes towards American occupation in Mosul; as exemplified in:</p>
								<p>A story about counterinsurgency and community organizing, about getting to know people as an occupying force, and getting to know people as neighbors. It is a story about the military entering the terrain of that thing called culture.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn182" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a></p>
								<p>In this regard, a ‘cultural approach’ to military occupation is akin to artistic social and community practices, as both involve “getting to know people to be able to change the landscapes of life and of power.”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn183" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> In the case of civilians in Mosul, this is done obviating their experiences under attack. This cultural turn in the U.S. military machinery took place a few years after theorist Frederic Jameson diagnosed a “cultural turn” in <span class="importantword">capitalism</span>, arguing that social space had been completely saturated with the image of culture. This is because in professional and daily activities, as well as in the various forms of entertainment we enjoy, society consumes cultural products all the time. The postmodern “cultural turn” diagnosed by Jameson, was further elaborated by George Yúdice upon observing (in 2003) that the uses of culture had undergone an unprecedented expansion not just in the marketplace but also along social, political, and economic lines. According to Yúdice, since the state and corporations already utilize culture as a tool as they search for economic and sociopolitical betterment, culture has become a resource and a compensatory device to the ravages neoliberal policies have caused on the social tissue: both give meaning and symbolic representations, provide mechanisms of solace, as well as tools for re-invention and amelioration.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn184" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> In this context, the line between public programs and relational aesthetics or participative art appears to be increasingly blurred. Former Mexican president Felipe Calderón made a public appearance in February 2012 in Ciudad Juárez before a sign that stated: “No More Weapons.” The billboard measured 8 x 21 m, and was built by soldiers of the National Defense Department with 3 tons of assault weapons confiscated at the border and molten into bricks. During the ceremony in which the billboard was unveiled, Calderón turned toward the Mexican-American border and begged the U.S. (in bad English): “No more weapons! Dear friends of the United States, Mexico needs your help to stop this terrible violence we are suffering.” During this trip, Calderón also participated in the destruction of 6 thousand confiscated weapons, and planted a tree at a Community Center. Calderon’s propagandistic gestures immediately recall the language of socially engaged contemporary art, particularly, Pedro Reyes’ intervention, <em>Palas por pistolas</em> in Culiacán in 2008 (also executed in Juárez in the same week of Calderon’s visit). Reyes’ project of exchanging shovels for weapons was subsidized by two predominant Mexican corporations: Trupper (which producers hardware) and Coppel (which sells appliances and other goods). For this project, Reyes devised a Television campaign inviting citizens to give up their weapons in exchange for a coupon exchangeable for appliances. The artist collected 1527 weapons, which were destroyed at a military zone in a public act. Giving his action a further twist, Reyes sought to have the rests of the weapons welded together to produce 1527 shovels carrying an inscription telling the story of the weapon they represented (this was not possible due to technical reasons, so Trupper ended up donating them). The engraved shovels were distributed in art institutions and public schools and adults and children planted 1527 trees. To Reyes, this ritual had a pedagogical purpose: “to show the people how an agent of death can become an agent of life.”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn185" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> A similar public purge of weapons in exchange for appliances (and tablets), is currently happening in Mexico City led by a “Pink Ladies Brigade.” These relational actions – both by General Petraeus’ and by the Mexican government, show how the language of contemporary art has been appropriated by propaganda for its purposes, making politics and aesthetics indistinguishable, as both operate in the realm of symbolic and perceptive work. These are also examples of the predominant idea that violence can be eased – or appeased – through cultural intervention and in the Mexican case, by giving away highly desirable goods.</p>
								<p>Aside from this ‘artistic approach’ to social, political and military action, sensible production has taken up a political function, as political work has been developed into a matter of codification using medial forms with the purpose of creating a terrain for political acts, creating an “activist imaginary” made of political fields constituted by images. Political action embedded in cultural forms implies making things public as a way of signs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn186" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> An example could be Trevor Paglen’s (sometimes abstract or blurry) photographs of top-secret governmental, nuclear and military sites. Works such as Paglen’s, seek to make visible the invisible under the premise that such an act is political. Yet, what images such as Paglen’s represent is vague in political terms. What I find problematic is that the gap between <em>political</em> representation and <em>aesthetic</em> representation is now wider than ever. Representation means “making the absent present,” which is always an incomplete task because totality is impossible to convey, and it works in two senses. As <em>Vertreten</em> (or political representation) it means taking the place of others in order to speak on their behalf, and as <em>Darstellen</em> (or aesthetic representation) it is the form of representation that implies describing the other in the first person. Representation was brought into a crisis in the 1960s because it was accused of hiding the fact that the speaker was occupying the place of the represented and thus, workers and minorities were prompted to speak on their behalf and in the first person. Nowadays, however, the gap between political (<em>Vertreten</em>) and aesthetic (<em>Darstellen</em>) representations is wider than ever because whatever political acts encoded in medial forms may represent, it renders it unstable – partly because politics have become unrepresentable due to lack of stable political subjects – as they are collective enunciations constantly ‘becoming.’ In this context, “expressive” politics is valued over representation because “it embodies rebellious subjectivities expressing themselves without delegation and they do so through formal and symbolic richness.”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn187" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> One of the issues that rises is that there is lack of a common ground to universalize the multiplicity of singular struggles and social movements scattered across the world like archipelagos. There are just too many images in the Infosphere, and ‘sensible politics’ exists for and by its own public, which is made up of social movements and politically minded cultural producers. In this regard, cultural infrastructure functions as the platform for ‘sensible politics,’ in which curators, museum directors and board members (sometimes representing corporate interests) select and contextualize artwork that presents certain events and social actions thus determining the boundaries of public thinking.</p>
								<p>Aside from its compensatory role, culture (insofar at it is ‘<span class="importantword">creativity</span>’ and cognitive production), is not only at the center of political action, but is also embedded in production and consumption <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es, and neoliberalism – in so far as it has thrived in post-fordist (flexible) forms and conditions of labor – which had taken up the characteristics of aesthetic production. Signs and nascent meanings, desires and projections meet in the market because the post-fordist economy is based on manufacturing experiences, signs and information. The core of the knowledge economy is <span class="importantword">creativity</span> and this is why qualities of aesthetic production have become hegemonic and have transformed labor and consumption <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es as well as aesthetic experiences. Not only sensations and feelings are being trivialized and packaged for sale. Disinterestedness (the core of aesthetic experience as defined by Kant) has also vanished.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn188" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> This arises as the result of aesthetic experience being enslaved for profit, as well as subsumed to “political” efficiency – in the sense of State and corporate strategic investment in culture, as well as it was the transformation of political action into sensible forms – as opposed to action. These tendencies are a result of what Stephen Shaviro describes as “the ruthless cognition of aesthetic sensations and feelings”, as they were transformed into data, exploited forms of labor, which were marketed as fresh experiences, exciting lifestyle choices, or as socially-responsible cultural activities. In the political arena, thirty years of neoliberalism have crushed any confidence that we might have had on the social contract. If artists used to identify with the proletariat and social struggles before, nowadays, aesthetic production – which is lacking a reflexive program in regards to the conditions of its own production – is geared just toward the supplementing of the entertainment market with cultivated and knowledgeable new experiences and sensations. Furthermore, through subsidizing art and cultural projects, corporations, states and arts patrons put into practice following principle of the Prince Claus Fund: “There can be no development without culture, and there can be no cultural development without freedom of debate.”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn189" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> As this quote becomes evermore evident, the public expects from culture and art rigorous accountability, critical questioning, democratic access, dialogue and openness as well as equal representation in the visual regime (and this is posited as the road to development). In this context, culture is perceived as “a basic need,” as the founding principle of Prince Claus Fund states. Thus, states, corporations, the private sector and society attribute to art a decisive political role on the one hand, as they invest in culture with the purpose of generating political and economic surplus value. Bearing in mind that the autonomy of art is always a political matter, could art be politicized beyond its autonomy as a site for added value?</p>
								<p>The condition of possibility of autonomous, committed art under the new neoliberal world order, is radically different from what we see as the autonomy of art under modernism (as <em>l’art pour l’art</em>) and post-modern interdisciplinarity. These imply the institutionalization of the avant-garde and the subsumption of art to the market, bearing in mind that the emancipatory promises of modernism (criticality, self-design, <span class="importantword">creativity</span>) are now located at the center of our everyday lives both via consumption and production <span class="keyword-searched">process</span>es. Theodor Adorno’s take on the autonomy of art in his (1962) essay entitled “Commitment,” can be helpful here. In this essay, Adorno responds to Jean-Paul Sartre’s aesthetic manifesto <em>What is Literature?</em> and elaborates a theoretical debate about engaged literature and autonomous art. According to Adorno, there are two kinds of works of art. On the one hand, there are works that “are vulgarly assimilated to the existence against which they protest.”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn190" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> These works “are content with being mere fetishes or a pass-time, and thus degenerate and become de-politicized cultural merchandise.”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn191" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> This de-politicization, for Adorno is in fact, deeply political – much politically or socially minded contemporary art would fit into this category. On the other hand, there is <em>engaged autonomous ar</em>t, which, as art, is necessarily detached from reality. Adorno defines the autonomy of art not in the sense of its strictly formalist aspect (although like Walter Benjamin, Adorno also vouches for works of art that are both formally and politically progressive). For Adorno, autonomous art negates a direct connection to reality. The distance that autonomous art has from reality, however, is mediated by reality itself: this means that a work of art cannot come out of the blue – its origin is a reaction against reality. Adorno, as does Benjamin, draws a distinction between ‘commitment’ and ‘tendency.’ Committed art does not bear the intention of generating betterment measures, legislative acts or practical institutions (like propaganda) or even transmitting a concrete ideology, but it operates at the level of fundamental attitudes. For Adorno, autonomous and engaged works of art operate at the level of abandoning the social contract with reality and “cease to speak as if they were reporting the facts: this is the moment in which a work of art makes people’s hair stand up.”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn192" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> According to Adorno, the shock of the unintelligible (or the ambiguous), is able to communicate more than what is legible and explicit. In that sense, works of art are autonomous, instead of heteronomous. Heteronomy implies that an artwork is subject to a different power, a law that is external and foreign to art and to its formal logic. When it is autonomous, engaged art is neither subject to empirical reality nor to a correct political tendency. Art’s autonomy protects it from popularization, from its adoption by the market and it implies liberating it from any other external purpose: from being useful. In this manner, an autonomous work of art does not convey a message nor does it need to convince the public (or preach to the converted). And although it opposes society, autonomous art is still part of it.</p>
								<p>If the autonomy of modern art implied considering art as a realm distanced from reality, art’s post-medium condition means that it has become a niche within reality.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn193" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> What is thus at stake in autonomous art nowadays, would be to posit it as an experience of reality that is fundamentally foreign and antagonistic to the prevailing reality. If the autonomy of art should be located in the realm of reproduction as Marina Vischmidt argues<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn194" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> – it would oppose the realm of production of the social, political and economic surplus value, as it would go against embodying power and the entrepreneurial model of work. Producing difference, dragging out the laboring conditions hidden within it, autonomous art would imply mimesis with distancing itself. Beyond being used as a tool, autonomous art would refuse becoming an instrument against its own illusions, as well as refusing to become a political force, or to be subjected to interests foreign to itself or simply becoming a pleasing commodity. Overcoming self-censorship, it would cease to participate in the economy of the globalized artworld, especially in the name of critical practices, political work or social justice, abandoning its claim to become a progressive social force.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn195" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> Above all, it would work against the power of culture and the culture of power.</p>
