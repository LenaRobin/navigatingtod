<dc:description>
An interactive full-length mirror that allows your customers to browse
through an endless collection of clothing that you offer and see
immediately whether something fits them, including when they turn
around, and which also allows them to send a picture quickly to their
family and friends to hear what they think. This mirror is a
technological development that is already possible and which is being
introduced in fashion stores here and there.

But how probable is it that this technological innovation will become a
permanent feature of our shopping experience? How probable is it that
you as a retailer will invest in such a mirror? And does such an
innovation will save the physical store from becoming obsolete while
more and more consumers are buying online? And who is that consumer
anyway and what does he or she need?

In <i>The Fashion Retailscape</i> developments in (fashion) retail are
critically analysed and enriched with insights from retailers in
Amsterdam.
